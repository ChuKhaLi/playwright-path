# MOD-05 Capstone Project: E-Commerce Test Automation Framework

## 1. Overview

This directory contains the capstone project for Module 5. The goal of this project is to apply all the concepts learned throughout the course to build a comprehensive, end-to-end test automation framework for a fictional e-commerce website.

This project serves as a key portfolio piece, demonstrating your ability to design, implement, and maintain a professional-grade test automation solution.

## 2. Project Structure

The project is organized into two main parts:

-   **[`project-01-e2e-framework/`](project-01-e2e-framework/):** This is the main project. It contains a complete, working E2E test automation framework built with Playwright and TypeScript. It includes a well-structured Page Object Model, a suite of tests, CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions, and detailed reporting.

-   **[`project-02-portfolio-enhancements/`](project-02-portfolio-enhancements/):** This directory contains materials related to the career development aspects of the module. It includes templates and exercises for building your resume, optimizing your LinkedIn profile, and creating a professional portfolio.
