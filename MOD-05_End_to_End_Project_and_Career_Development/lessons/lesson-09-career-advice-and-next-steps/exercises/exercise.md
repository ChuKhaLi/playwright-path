    -   Add 2-3 bullet points describing your accomplishments using action verbs (e.g., "Designed and implemented a scalable Page Object Model...").
3.  **Review your experience section.**
    -   Find at least one bullet point and rewrite it to be more quantifiable.
    -   *Before:* "Wrote automated tests."
