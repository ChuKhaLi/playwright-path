# Exercise: Make Your First Open-Source Contribution

## 1. Objective

The goal of this exercise is to demystify the process of contributing to open-source by guiding you through finding a project and making a small, manageable contribution. The focus is on documentation, as it's one of the best and most accessible ways to get started.

## 2. Instructions

### Part 1: Find a Project and an Issue

1.  **Explore the Playwright Repository:**
    -   Go to the official [Playwright GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright).
    -   Click on the "Issues" tab.
    -   Filter the issues by the label `good first issue` or `docs`. This will show you issues that the maintainers have identified as suitable for new contributors, often related to documentation.

2.  **Find a Documentation Issue:**
    -   Look for an issue that seems interesting and manageable. This could be:
        -   A typo in the documentation.
        -   A code example that is unclear or incorrect.
        -   A section of the docs that is missing information.
    -   Read the issue and the comments to understand the problem.

3.  **"Claim" the Issue (Optional but Recommended):**
    -   Leave a comment on the issue saying that you'd like to work on it. This prevents multiple people from working on the same thing.
    -   *Example Comment:* "Hi, I'm new to contributing here and would love to help with this. I can take a look and open a PR."

### Part 2: Make the Contribution

1.  **Follow the Contribution Workflow:**
    -   **Fork** the Playwright repository.
    -   **Clone** your fork to your local machine.
    -   Create a new **branch** for your changes.
    -   **Make the changes** to the documentation files. Documentation is often written in Markdown (`.md`) files.
    -   **Commit** your changes with a clear message (Playwright has guidelines on commit message formats, so be sure to check their `CONTRIBUTING.md` file).
    -   **Push** your branch to your fork on GitHub.
    -   Open a **Pull Request** to the main Playwright repository.

2.  **Write a Good Pull Request Description:**
    -   In your PR description, link to the issue you are fixing (e.g., "Fixes #12345").
    -   Briefly explain the changes you made and why.

### Part 3: The Alternative Path (If you can't find an issue)

If you can't find a suitable issue, you can still contribute!

1.  **Read the Docs:** Spend some time reading through the official Playwright documentation.
2.  **Find an Improvement:** Look for typos, grammatical errors, or sentences that are confusing. Even a one-word fix is a valuable contribution.
3.  **Submit a PR:** Follow the same workflow to submit a PR with your suggested improvement. In the description, explain what you changed and why it's an improvement.

## 3. Career Development Reflection

-   What was the most intimidating part of this process? How did you overcome it?
-   After going through the process, does contributing to a large project like Playwright seem more or less difficult than you imagined?
-   How would you describe this contribution on your resume or in an interview? Think about the skills it demonstrates (e.g., using Git, collaborating on a large codebase, improving documentation).
