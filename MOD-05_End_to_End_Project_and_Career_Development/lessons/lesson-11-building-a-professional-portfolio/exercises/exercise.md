# Exercise: Create Your Portfolio `README.md`

## 1. Objective

The goal of this exercise is to create a high-quality, professional `README.md` file for your E2E test automation project. This will serve as the centerpiece of your portfolio.

## 2. Instructions

### Step 1: Create or Enhance Your Project's `README.md`

1.  **Navigate to your E2E framework project's root directory.**
2.  **Open the `README.md` file.** If you don't have one, create it now.
3.  **Structure the `README.md`** using the key sections from the lesson. Use Markdown for formatting (e.g., `#` for headings, `*` for bullet points, ``` for code blocks).

### Step 2: Write the Content for Each Section

1.  **Project Title and Description:**
    -   Give your project a professional name (e.g., "E-Commerce Test Automation Framework").
    -   Write a 2-3 sentence paragraph describing the project's purpose.

2.  **Features:**
    -   Create a bulleted list of the key features of your framework.
    -   *Examples:* "Page Object Model design pattern," "TypeScript for type safety," "GitHub Actions for CI/CD," "Detailed HTML reporting."

3.  **Tech Stack:**
    -   List the main technologies you used. Using icons or badges here can look very professional (you can find these by searching for "Markdown badges").
    -   *Examples:* Playwright, TypeScript, Node.js, GitHub Actions.

4.  **Getting Started:**
    -   Provide clear, step-by-step instructions for someone to get your project running on their machine.
    -   Include the commands for cloning the repository, installing dependencies (`npm ci`), and any other setup steps.

5.  **Running the Tests:**
    -   State the exact command needed to run the entire test suite (e.g., `npx playwright test`).
    -   Mention any other available test scripts (e.g., how to run tests in headed mode).

6.  **Reporting:**
    -   Explain how to access the HTML report after a test run.
    -   **Bonus:** Take a screenshot of your Playwright HTML report and embed it in the `README.md`. You can do this by placing the screenshot in your repository and using the Markdown image syntax: `![Report Screenshot](path/to/your/screenshot.png)`.

### Step 3: Pin the Repository to Your GitHub Profile

1.  **Push your updated `README.md` to GitHub.**
2.  **Go to your main GitHub profile page.**
3.  **Find the "Pinned" section** on the right-hand side and click "Customize your pins."
4.  **Select your E2E framework project** to pin it to your profile. It will now be one of the first things people see when they visit your profile.

## 3. Career Development Reflection

-   Imagine a recruiter or hiring manager is looking at your project's `README.md`. What is the single most important piece of information you want them to take away from it?
-   How does a detailed `README.md` demonstrate skills beyond just coding? (e.g., communication, documentation, user empathy).
-   Compare your GitHub profile before and after pinning your well-documented project. What kind of impression does it give now?
