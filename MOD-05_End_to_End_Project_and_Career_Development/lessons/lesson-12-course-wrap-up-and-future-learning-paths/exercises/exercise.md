    -   Identify the **three topics** you enjoyed the most or felt you were strongest in.
    -   Identify the **one topic** you found the most challenging or feel you need more practice with.

### Part 2: Create Your 6-Month Learning Roadmap

1.  **Choose Your Focus Areas:**
    -   Based on your self-assessment and the "Future Learning Roadmap" section of the lesson, choose **two main areas** you want to focus on for the next six months.
    -   *Example Focus Areas:* "Advanced CI/CD with Docker" and "API Testing with Playwright."

2.  **Structure Your Roadmap:**
    -   Create a new Markdown file named `my-learning-roadmap.md`.
    -   Create two main headings, one for each of your chosen focus areas.

3.  **Define Goals and Actions for Each Focus Area:**
    -   For each focus area, define one high-level **SMART goal** for the six-month period.

### **Focus Area 1: API Testing with Playwright**

**6-Month Goal:** To be proficient in API testing using Playwright, capable of building a standalone API test suite and integrating API tests into E2E flows.

**Monthly Milestones:**

-   **Month 1:**
    -   **Action:** Thoroughly read the official Playwright documentation on API testing.
    -   **Action:** Complete a beginner's online tutorial on REST APIs to solidify fundamentals.
    -   **Resource:** Playwright Docs, "Intro to REST APIs" YouTube series.
-   **Month 2:**
    -   **Action:** Build a small project to test a public API (e.g., the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)).
    -   **Action:** Implement tests for all major HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
-   **Month 3:**
    -   **Action:** Refactor the project to use a `BaseAPI` class for common setup (like setting base URLs and headers).
    -   **Action:** Learn how to validate JSON schemas in your tests.
-   **Month 4-6:**
    -   **Action:** Integrate API tests into your existing E2E framework to handle test data setup or authentication.
    -   **Action:** Write a blog post explaining how to test a specific API endpoint with Playwright.
