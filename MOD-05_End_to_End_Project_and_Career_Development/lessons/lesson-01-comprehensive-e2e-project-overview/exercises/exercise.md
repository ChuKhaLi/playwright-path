# Exercise: Project Scoping and Planning

## 1. Objective

This exercise is designed to help you think critically about the planning phase of a test automation project. By defining the scope and creating a plan, you'll be better prepared to tackle the hands-on coding in the upcoming lessons.

## 2. Instructions

### Part 1: Define the Scope

1.  **Identify Key Features:** Based on the lesson, list the key features of the sample e-commerce application we'll be testing.
2.  **Prioritize Test Scenarios:** For each feature, brainstorm at least two specific user scenarios that should be tested. Think about both "happy path" and "negative" scenarios.
    -   *Example for Login:*
        -   Happy Path: A registered user can log in with valid credentials.
        -   Negative Path: A user cannot log in with an invalid password.
3.  **Define "Done":** For one of your prioritized scenarios, write a clear definition of what it means for the test to be "done" or "passing." What specific conditions must be met?

### Part 2: High-Level Project Plan

1.  **Outline the Phases:** In your own words, create a high-level project plan with the key phases you'll follow to build the test automation framework.
2.  **Estimate Effort (Optional):** For each phase, try to estimate the relative effort required (e.g., "Low," "Medium," "High"). This is a great way to practice project management skills.
3.  **Identify Potential Risks:** Brainstorm at least three potential risks or challenges you might face during this project. For each risk, suggest a possible mitigation strategy.
    -   *Example Risk:* The application's UI changes frequently, breaking our locators.
    -   *Mitigation:* Use robust locator strategies (like `getByRole`) and implement the Page Object Model to centralize locator management.

## 3. Submission

-   Create a new Markdown file named `project-plan.md`.
-   Document your answers to all the questions from Part 1 and Part 2 in this file.
-   There's no need to submit this file, but keep it handy. We'll refer back to it as we progress through the module.

## 4. Career Development Reflection

-   After completing this exercise, take a moment to think about how you would present this plan in a job interview.
-   How does this type of planning demonstrate your value as a QA automation engineer beyond just writing code?
