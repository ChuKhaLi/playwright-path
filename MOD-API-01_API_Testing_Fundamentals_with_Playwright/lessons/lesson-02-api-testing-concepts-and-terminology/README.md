# Lesson 2: API Testing Concepts and Terminology

## 📚 Lesson Overview

Now that you understand the language of APIs (HTTP), this lesson introduces you to the world of API testing itself. We'll define what an API is in a practical context, explore why API testing is a critical part of a modern QA strategy, and introduce the essential terminology you'll need to speak fluently about your API tests.

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- **Define** what an API is and explain its role in software applications.
- **Explain** the key benefits of API testing (speed, stability, early feedback).
- **Differentiate** between various types of API testing (e.g., functional, load, security).
- **Define and identify** core API testing terms: Endpoint, Resource, Payload, and API Contract.
- **Understand** the API testing lifecycle and its place in the development process.

### 🔑 Key Focus Areas
- The "Why" of API Testing
- The Testing Pyramid
- Core Terminology (Endpoint, Resource, Payload)
- Types of API Tests

### ⏱️ Duration
**1 hour** | **Type**: API Foundation

### 🔗 Prerequisites
- Completion of Lesson 1: HTTP Fundamentals for Testers.
