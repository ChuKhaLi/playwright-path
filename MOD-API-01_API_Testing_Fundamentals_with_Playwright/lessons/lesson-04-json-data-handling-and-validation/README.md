# Lesson 4: JSON Data Handling and Validation

## 📚 Lesson Overview

In modern API testing, you will be working with **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** every single day. It is the standard format for data exchange in RESTful APIs. This lesson covers everything you need to know to confidently handle and validate JSON payloads in your Playwright tests, from understanding its syntax to performing complex assertions.

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- **Explain** what JSON is and why it's used in APIs.
- **Identify** and differentiate between JSON data types (string, number, boolean, array, object, null).
- **Read and write** well-formed JSON.
- **Parse** JSON responses into usable JavaScript objects in your tests.
- **Navigate and assert** on values within complex, nested JSON structures.
- **Understand** the concept of schema validation and its importance.

### 🔑 Key Focus Areas
- JSON Syntax and Data Types
- Parsing JSON in TypeScript
- Asserting on JSON with `expect`
- Handling Nested Objects and Arrays
- Introduction to JSON Schema Validation

### ⏱️ Duration
**1.5 hours** | **Type**: API Foundation

### 🔗 Prerequisites
- Completion of Lesson 3: Introduction to REST APIs
- Basic understanding of JavaScript/TypeScript objects and arrays.

## 📖 What You'll Learn

### Core Concepts
- The structure of JSON objects and arrays.
- The rules of JSON syntax.
- How to convert a JSON string into a JavaScript object (`JSON.parse`) and vice-versa (`JSON.stringify`).
- Strategies for validating the structure and data types of a JSON payload.

### Practical Application
- How to use Playwright's `.json()` helper to automatically parse response bodies.
- Writing Playwright assertions to check for specific values in a JSON response.
- How to test nested data and items within arrays.
- An introduction to using libraries like `zod` or `ajv` for robust schema validation.

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

After completing this lesson, you'll be able to:
- Read any JSON payload and understand its structure.
- Write robust Playwright tests that can validate complex API responses.
- Go beyond simple equality checks and perform deep validation of JSON objects and arrays.
- Appreciate the importance of validating not just the data, but the *shape* (schema) of an API response.
