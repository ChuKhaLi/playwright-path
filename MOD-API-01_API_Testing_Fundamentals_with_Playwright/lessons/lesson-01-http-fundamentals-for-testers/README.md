# Lesson 1: HTTP Fundamentals for Testers

## 📚 Lesson Overview

This lesson provides essential HTTP knowledge specifically tailored for API testers. Understanding HTTP is the foundation of effective API testing, as it governs how clients communicate with servers and how APIs exchange data. This lesson focuses on the request/response cycle from a testing perspective, emphasizing concepts that directly impact API test design and validation.

### 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- **Understand** the HTTP request/response model and its importance in API testing
- **Identify** and use common HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) appropriately
- **Analyze** HTTP request structure including method, URL, headers, and body
- **Interpret** HTTP response structure including status codes, headers, and body
- **Categorize** HTTP status codes (2xx, 4xx, 5xx) and understand their testing implications
- **Apply** HTTP knowledge to design effective API test scenarios

### ⏱️ Duration
**1-2 hours** | **Type**: API Foundation

### 🔗 Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of client-server architecture
- Familiarity with web applications and how they work
- No prior API testing experience required
