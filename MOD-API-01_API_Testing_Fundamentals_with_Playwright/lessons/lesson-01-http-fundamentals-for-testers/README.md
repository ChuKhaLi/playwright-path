# Lesson 1: HTTP Fundamentals for Testers

## üìö Lesson Overview

This lesson provides essential HTTP knowledge specifically tailored for API testers. Understanding HTTP is the foundation of effective API testing, as it governs how clients communicate with servers and how APIs exchange data. This lesson focuses on the request/response cycle from a testing perspective, emphasizing concepts that directly impact API test design and validation, especially when using Playwright.

### üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- **Explain** the HTTP request/response model and its importance in API testing.
- **Differentiate** between common HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) and their use cases.
- **Deconstruct** an HTTP request into its core components: method, URL, headers, and body.
- **Analyze** an HTTP response by interpreting its status code, headers, and body.
- **Classify** HTTP status codes (2xx, 4xx, 5xx) and determine their testing implications.
- **Translate** HTTP concepts into practical API test scenarios.

### üîë Key Focus Areas
- HTTP Methods and Status Codes
- Request/Response Structure
- Headers and Content Types
- Practical Application in API Testing
- Connection to Playwright's `request` fixture

### ‚è±Ô∏è Duration
**1-2 hours** | **Type**: API Foundation

### üîó Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of client-server architecture.
- Familiarity with web applications and how they work.
- No prior API testing experience is required.

## üìñ What You'll Learn

### Core HTTP Concepts for API Testing
- The request/response communication model using a real-world analogy.
- The semantic meaning of HTTP methods and why they matter for test design.
- The structure of HTTP requests and responses.
- The significance of status code categories in test validation.

### Practical Application
- How to analyze raw HTTP request and response examples.
- How to design test scenarios for different HTTP methods.
- How error handling works in HTTP and what to validate in error responses.
- How these concepts directly apply to tests written with Playwright's `request` fixture.
