# MOD-API-01: API Testing Fundamentals with Playwright

## 📚 Module Overview

This module provides a comprehensive introduction to API testing using Playwright's built-in `request` fixture. It covers the fundamental concepts of APIs, HTTP, and REST, and then dives into practical, hands-on testing of API endpoints.

### 🎯 Learning Outcomes

By completing this module, you will:
- Understand the core concepts of API testing and its terminology.
- Grasp the fundamentals of the HTTP protocol and RESTful principles.
- Handle and validate JSON data, the de facto standard for modern APIs.
- Use Playwright's `request` fixture to make GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests.
- Write effective assertions to validate API responses, including status codes, headers, and body content.
- Manage authentication and authorization in your API tests.
- Work with headers and cookies to simulate real user sessions.
- Implement data-driven testing strategies for your API tests.
- Learn best practices for organizing and structuring API test code.

### 🎯 Assessment Strategy

- **Knowledge Checks**: Quizzes on HTTP, REST, and JSON concepts.
- **Practical Labs**: Hands-on exercises to write API tests for a sample REST API.
- **Final Project**: Develop a complete API test suite that covers all CRUD operations, authentication, and data validation.

### 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Review Prerequisites**: Ensure you have a solid understanding of the foundational web concepts.
2. **API Under Test**: We will be using a public demo API for all exercises. Details will be provided in the lessons.
3. **Begin Lesson 1.1**: Start with the HTTP fundamentals.
