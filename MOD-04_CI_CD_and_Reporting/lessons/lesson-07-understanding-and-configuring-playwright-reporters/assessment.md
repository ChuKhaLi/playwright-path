**Question 4.1: Reporter Lifecycle (8 points)**

Explain the Playwright Reporter interface lifecycle methods and their appropriate use cases:

1. **onBegin()** - When and why would you use this method? Provide two practical examples.
2. **onTestEnd()** - What data is available at this point, and what are the performance considerations?
3. **onEnd()** - What final processing should occur here, and why is async handling important?

- Practical examples and use cases (2 points)
- Performance and design considerations (2 points)

**Question 4.2: Performance Optimization (6 points)**

A test suite with 2000 tests is running slowly due to reporter overhead. Analyze the following reporter code and identify optimization opportunities:

```typescript
class SlowReporter implements Reporter {
  async onTestEnd(test: TestCase, result: TestResult) {
    // Send individual notification for each test
    await fetch('/api/notify', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({
        test: test.title,
        status: result.status,
        duration: result.duration
      })
    });
    
    // Write individual log file for each test
    fs.writeFileSync(`./logs/${test.title}.log`, 
      JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));
    
    // Take screenshot analysis for every test
    if (result.attachments.length > 0) {
      for (const attachment of result.attachments) {
        await processScreenshot(attachment.path);
      }
    }
  }
}
