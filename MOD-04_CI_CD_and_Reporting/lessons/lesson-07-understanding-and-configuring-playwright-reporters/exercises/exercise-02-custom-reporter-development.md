# Exercise 02: Custom Reporter Development

## Objective
Develop custom Playwright reporters that integrate with enterprise monitoring systems and provide stakeholder-specific insights.

## Learning Goals
- Implement the Playwright Reporter interface
- Create reporters for different monitoring systems
- Handle real-time notifications and alerts
- Build data transformation pipelines for dashboards
- Implement error handling and performance optimization

## Prerequisites
- Completed Exercise 01: Reporter Configuration
- Understanding of TypeScript interfaces and classes
- Basic knowledge of REST APIs and webhooks
- Familiarity with monitoring systems (DataDog, New Relic, etc.)

## Exercise Overview
You'll build three custom reporters: a Slack notification reporter, a metrics collection reporter, and a dashboard integration reporter. Each serves different stakeholder needs and demonstrates key custom reporter patterns.

## Part 1: Slack Notification Reporter (35 minutes)

### Task 1.1: Basic Slack Reporter Implementation
Create a custom reporter that sends test completion notifications to Slack.

**Requirements:**
- Send notifications for test run completion
- Include summary statistics (pass/fail counts, duration)
- Handle failed test details with error messages
- Support different channels for different environments

**Implementation Template:**
```typescript
import { Reporter, TestCase, TestResult, FullResult } from '@playwright/test/reporter';

interface SlackReporterOptions {
  webhookUrl: string;
  channel?: string;
  environment?: string;
  onlyOnFailure?: boolean;
  includeErrorDetails?: boolean;
}

class SlackReporter implements Reporter {
  constructor(options: SlackReporterOptions) {
    // Your implementation here
  }

  onBegin(config: any, suite: any): void {
    // Initialize run tracking
  }

  onTestEnd(test: TestCase, result: TestResult): void {
    // Track individual test results
  }

  async onEnd(result: FullResult): Promise<void> {
    // Send Slack notification
  }
}
```

**Expected Features:**
- Rich message formatting with emojis and colors
- Clickable links to HTML reports
- Environment-specific channels
- Rate limiting and error handling

### Task 1.2: Advanced Slack Integration
Enhance your Slack reporter with advanced features.

**Advanced Requirements:**
- Real-time failure notifications during test execution
- Thread replies for detailed error information
- Attachment support for screenshots
- User mentions for critical failures
- Custom Slack blocks for rich formatting

**Integration Features:**
```typescript
// Thread management for detailed discussions
// Custom Slack blocks for structured data
// File upload integration for screenshots
// User notification patterns
```

## Part 2: Metrics Collection Reporter (40 minutes)

### Task 2.1: Performance Metrics Reporter
Build a reporter that collects detailed performance and reliability metrics.

**Requirements:**
- Track test execution timing and performance
- Collect browser performance metrics
- Monitor memory usage and resource consumption
- Export metrics in Prometheus format
- Store historical data for trend analysis

**Metrics to Capture:**
```typescript
interface TestMetrics {
  // Execution metrics
  testDuration: number;
  setupTime: number;
  teardownTime: number;
  
  // Performance metrics
  pageLoadTime?: number;
  networkRequests?: number;
  jsHeapSize?: number;
  
  // Reliability metrics
  retryCount: number;
  flakiness: number;
  errorCategories: string[];
}
```

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Efficient metrics collection without impacting test performance
- Configurable metric storage backends (file, database, API)
- Proper error handling for metrics collection failures
- Metrics aggregation and summarization

### Task 2.2: Dashboard Integration Reporter
Create a reporter that feeds data to business intelligence dashboards.

**Requirements:**
- Transform test data for dashboard consumption
- Support multiple output formats (JSON, CSV, XML)
- Implement real-time data streaming
- Handle large datasets efficiently
- Provide data validation and quality checks

**Dashboard Integration Points:**
- Grafana dashboard creation
- Tableau data source integration
- Power BI dataset generation
- Custom dashboard API endpoints

## Part 3: Monitoring System Integration (45 minutes)

### Task 3.1: DataDog Integration Reporter
Build a comprehensive monitoring integration with DataDog.

**Requirements:**
- Send custom metrics to DataDog
- Create events for test run start/completion
- Set up alerts for test failures
- Track test performance trends
- Implement proper error handling and retry logic

**DataDog Integration Features:**
```typescript
interface DataDogMetrics {
  // Test execution metrics
  'playwright.tests.total': number;
  'playwright.tests.passed': number;
  'playwright.tests.failed': number;
  'playwright.test.duration': number;
  
  // Performance metrics
  'playwright.page.load_time': number;
  'playwright.network.requests': number;
  'playwright.memory.heap_size': number;
}
```

### Task 3.2: Multi-Platform Monitoring
Extend your monitoring reporter to support multiple platforms.

**Supported Platforms:**
- DataDog (metrics and events)
- New Relic (custom events and metrics)
- Grafana (custom dashboard data)
- Generic webhook endpoints
- Custom monitoring solutions

**Implementation Patterns:**
- Plugin architecture for different platforms
- Common interface for metric submission
- Platform-specific configuration
- Fallback mechanisms for failed submissions

## Part 4: Advanced Reporter Patterns (35 minutes)

### Task 4.1: Batch Processing Reporter
Implement a reporter that efficiently handles large test suites.

**Requirements:**
- Batch test results for efficient processing
- Implement memory-efficient streaming
- Handle backpressure and flow control
- Provide progress reporting for long operations
- Implement graceful shutdown handling

**Performance Considerations:**
```typescript
class BatchProcessingReporter implements Reporter {
  private batchSize: number = 100;
  private processingQueue: TestResult[] = [];
  private batchTimer?: NodeJS.Timeout;
  
  // Implement efficient batching logic
}
```

### Task 4.2: Resilient Reporter Architecture
Build error-resilient reporters with proper failure handling.

**Resilience Features:**
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Circuit breaker pattern for external services
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- Local fallback storage for failed transmissions
- Health check monitoring for external dependencies
