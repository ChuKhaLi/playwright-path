# Exercise 01: Reporter Configuration Mastery

## Objective
Master the configuration of built-in Playwright reporters and understand their use cases in different environments.

## Learning Goals
- Configure multiple built-in reporters simultaneously
- Understand when to use different reporter types
- Implement environment-specific reporter configurations
- Troubleshoot common reporter configuration issues

## Prerequisites
- Completed MOD-04 lessons 01-06
- Basic understanding of Playwright configuration
- Familiarity with CI/CD environments

## Exercise Overview
You'll configure a comprehensive reporting setup that works across development, CI/CD, and production environments using Playwright's built-in reporters.

## Part 1: Multi-Reporter Configuration (20 minutes)

### Task 1.1: Basic Multi-Reporter Setup
Create a `playwright.config.ts` that uses multiple reporters simultaneously.

**Requirements:**
- Use HTML reporter for local development
- Use JUnit reporter for CI/CD integration
- Use JSON reporter for data analysis
- Configure appropriate output directories for each

**Expected Configuration:**
```typescript
// Your configuration should include:
// - HTML reporter with open: 'never' for CI
// - JUnit reporter with outputFile
// - JSON reporter with outputFile
// - Line reporter for console output
```

**Validation Criteria:**
- [ ] All reporters generate output without conflicts
- [ ] HTML report opens automatically in development
- [ ] JUnit XML is valid and parseable
- [ ] JSON output contains complete test metadata

### Task 1.2: Environment-Specific Configuration
Extend your configuration to behave differently based on environment.

**Requirements:**
- Development: HTML + Line reporters
- CI/CD: JUnit + JSON + Line reporters
- Production: JSON + Custom monitoring reporter

**Implementation Hints:**
```typescript
const isCI = !!process.env.CI;
const environment = process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development';

// Use conditional logic to set reporters array
```

## Part 2: Reporter Customization (25 minutes)

### Task 2.1: HTML Reporter Customization
Customize the HTML reporter with advanced options.

**Requirements:**
- Custom report title with environment info
- Include screenshots only for failed tests
- Enable trace viewer links
- Set custom CSS theme

**Expected Features:**
```typescript
use: {
  // Include environment in screenshots
  screenshot: 'only-on-failure',
  trace: 'retain-on-failure',
  // Custom viewport for consistent screenshots
}

reporter: [
  ['html', {
    // Your custom configuration here
  }]
]
```

### Task 2.2: JUnit Reporter Enhancement
Configure JUnit reporter for optimal CI/CD integration.

**Requirements:**
- Include test metadata in JUnit XML
- Add custom properties (browser, environment, build info)
- Configure appropriate test suite names
- Handle special characters in test names

**Integration Points:**
- Jenkins/Azure DevOps test result parsing
- Test result trend analysis
- Failure categorization

## Part 3: Advanced Configuration Patterns (30 minutes)

### Task 3.1: Conditional Reporter Loading
Implement dynamic reporter loading based on command-line arguments.

**Requirements:**
- Support `--reporter` CLI argument
- Allow multiple reporter specifications
- Provide sensible defaults
- Handle invalid reporter configurations gracefully

**Example Usage:**
```bash
# Single reporter
npx playwright test --reporter html

# Multiple reporters
npx playwright test --reporter html,junit,json

# Environment-specific
npx playwright test --reporter ci
```

### Task 3.2: Reporter Performance Optimization
Optimize reporter configuration for large test suites.

**Requirements:**
- Minimize memory usage during test execution
- Optimize file I/O operations
- Handle large attachment files efficiently
- Implement progressive report generation

**Performance Considerations:**
- Reporter execution order
- Async vs sync operations
- Memory cleanup strategies
- File system optimization

## Part 4: Troubleshooting Common Issues (20 minutes)

### Task 4.1: Debug Reporter Problems
Identify and fix common reporter configuration issues.

**Common Problems to Solve:**
1. Reporters conflicting with each other
2. Output directory permissions
3. Large attachment files causing memory issues
4. Unicode characters in test names breaking XML
5. Missing dependencies for custom reporters

**Debugging Approach:**
```typescript
// Add debugging configuration
reporter: [
  ['html', { 
    outputFolder: './test-results/html',
    open: process.env.CI ? 'never' : 'always'
  }],
  // Add your debugging steps here
]
```

### Task 4.2: CI/CD Integration Validation
Ensure your reporter configuration works in CI/CD environments.

**Validation Checklist:**
- [ ] Reports generate without user interaction
- [ ] Output paths are accessible to CI system
- [ ] File permissions are correctly set
- [ ] Reports don't break build process
- [ ] Artifacts are properly archived

## Part 5: Real-World Scenario (25 minutes)

### Scenario: Enterprise Multi-Environment Setup
You're configuring Playwright for a large enterprise with multiple environments and stakeholder requirements.

**Requirements:**
- **Development**: Fast feedback with HTML reports
- **CI/CD**: JUnit for test management integration, JSON for metrics
- **Staging**: Comprehensive HTML reports with traces for debugging
- **Production**: Minimal JSON logging with alert integration

**Stakeholder Needs:**
- QA Team: Detailed HTML reports with screenshots
- DevOps: JUnit integration with Jenkins
- Management: JSON data for dashboard metrics
- Support: Trace files for production issue debugging

**Implementation Task:**
Create a complete configuration that satisfies all requirements while maintaining performance and reliability.

## Submission Requirements
