## üéØ Decision Framework

### **Step 1: Evaluate Current State**
```yaml
current-assessment:
  team-size: [small/medium/large]
  technical-stack: [github/bitbucket/gitlab/other]
  existing-tools: [list-current-ci-cd-tools]
  budget-constraints: [tight/moderate/flexible]
  compliance-requirements: [none/basic/strict]
  timeline: [immediate/3-months/6-months]
```

### **Step 2: Apply Weighted Scoring**
```yaml
# Customize weights based on your priorities
scoring-weights:
  integration: 25%  # How important is ecosystem integration?
  usability: 20%    # How important is ease of use?
  performance: 20%  # How important is speed and scalability?
  cost: 15%         # How important is cost optimization?
  security: 10%     # How important are security features?
  support: 10%      # How important is vendor support?

# Calculate weighted scores
platform-scores:
  github-actions: 4.1/5.0
  jenkins: 3.7/5.0
  azure-devops: 3.8/5.0
  circleci: 3.9/5.0
```

### **Step 3: Risk Assessment**
```yaml
risk-factors:
  vendor-lock-in:
    github-actions: medium
    jenkins: low
    azure-devops: high
    circleci: medium
    
  maintenance-overhead:

    jenkins: high
    azure-devops: medium
    circleci: low
    
  learning-curve:
    github-actions: low
    jenkins: high
    azure-devops: medium
    circleci: medium
    
  scalability-limits:
    github-actions: medium
    jenkins: low
    azure-devops: low
