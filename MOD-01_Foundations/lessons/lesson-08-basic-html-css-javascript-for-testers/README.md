# Lesson 8: Basic HTML, CSS, & JavaScript for Testers

## Overview

While we introduced web technologies in a previous lesson, this lesson provides a more hands-on, practical look at the aspects of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that are most relevant to a test automation engineer. You will learn how to read HTML, understand CSS selectors, and recognize basic JavaScript events, all from the perspective of someone who needs to automate and test them.
