# Lesson 14: Advanced XPath Techniques

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
-   Write complex XPath expressions using nested predicates and logical operators.
-   Utilize advanced XPath functions for string manipulation, date handling, and conditional logic.
-   Select elements based on their position relative to other elements in the DOM.
-   Handle dynamic and unpredictable web elements with robust XPath strategies.
-   Optimize XPath expressions for performance and maintainability.

## Introduction

In the previous lesson, you learned the fundamentals of XPath. Now, it's time to explore the more powerful and complex features that make XPath an indispensable tool for QA automation. Advanced XPath techniques allow you to target elements with surgical precision, even in the most complex and dynamic web applications.

## 1. Complex Predicates and Logic

You can combine multiple conditions within predicates to create highly specific selectors.

### Chaining and Nesting Predicates

You can apply multiple predicates to a single node to filter it progressively.

```xpath
// Selects the third 'product-item' div that also has a 'featured' class
//div[@class='product-item'][3][@data-featured='true']
```

### Using Logical Operators (`and`, `or`, `not()`)

Logical operators are essential for combining different conditions.

-   **`and`**: Both conditions must be true.
-   **`or`**: At least one condition must be true.
-   **`not()`**: Negates a condition.

**Example:** Select a button that is a submit button OR has the text "Go".

```xpath
//button[@type='submit' or text()='Go']
```

**Example:** Select an input that is required but is NOT disabled.

```xpath
//input[@required and not(@disabled)]
```

## 2. Advanced XPath Functions

XPath 2.0 and later versions introduced a rich set of functions, although browser support can vary. Always test in your target browser.

### String Functions

-   **`concat()`**: Joins two or more strings. Useful for creating dynamic text matches.
    ```xpath
    //div[text()=concat('User: ', 'JohnDoe')]
    ```
-   **`substring-before()` / `substring-after()`**: Extracts a portion of a string before or after a specified character.
    ```xpath
    //div[substring-before(@id, '-')='user']
    ```
-   **`string-length()`**: Returns the length of a string.
    ```xpath
    //input[@type='password' and string-length(@value) > 8]
    ```

### Number Functions

-   **`round()`**, **`floor()`**, **`ceiling()`**: Perform mathematical rounding.
    ```xpath
    //div[round(@data-price) = 100]
    ```
-   **`sum()`**: Calculates the sum of a node-set.
    ```xpath
    //table/tbody/tr/td[sum(preceding-sibling::td) > 100]
    ```

### Node Functions

-   **`name()`**: Returns the tag name of the current node.
    ```xpath
    //*[name()='div' or name()='span']
    ```

## 3. Advanced Axis-Based Selection

Combining axes with predicates allows for powerful relative selections.

### Finding an Element Based on a Sibling

Select an input field that comes after a label with the text "Email".

```xpath
//label[text()='Email']/following-sibling::input[1]
```

### Finding an Element Based on a Child

Select a `div` that contains an `h2` element with the text "Login".

```xpath
//div[.//h2[text()='Login']]
```
*Note the `.` within the predicate, which makes the inner XPath relative to the `div` being tested.*

### Finding an Element Based on an Ancestor

Select all `input` elements within a `form` that has a specific `id`.

```xpath
//form[@id='main-form']//input
```

## 4. Handling Dynamic Elements

Modern web applications often have elements with dynamic IDs or classes.

### Using `contains()`, `starts-with()`, `ends-with()`

These functions are your best friends for handling dynamic attributes. `ends-with()` is part of XPath 2.0 and may not be supported in all browsers.

**Example:** Select an element whose `id` starts with "dyn_".

```xpath
//*[starts-with(@id, 'dyn_')]
```

**Example:** Select an element whose `class` contains the word "active".

```xpath
//div[contains(@class, 'active')]
```

### The `contains()` trick for full class name match

Sometimes `contains(@class, 'active')` is too broad. To match a full class name within a space-separated list, use this trick:

```xpath
//div[contains(concat(' ', normalize-space(@class), ' '), ' active ')]
```
This ensures you don't accidentally match "inactive".

## 5. Performance and Optimization

While powerful, complex XPath can be slow. Here are some tips to keep your tests fast:

-   **Be as specific as possible:** Avoid starting with `//` if you can provide a more direct path from a known element (e.g., `//div[@id='main-content']//button`).
-   **Avoid `*` where possible:** Specifying the tag name (`div`, `a`, etc.) is faster than the wildcard.
-   **Prefer CSS selectors for simple cases:** If you don't need XPath's special features, a CSS selector is often faster.
-   **Limit the use of `last()` and indexing on large node-sets:** These can be slow as the browser has to find all matching nodes first.

## Summary

Mastering advanced XPath techniques is a superpower for any QA automation engineer. It allows you to create selectors that are not only precise but also resilient to changes in the application's UI. By understanding how to combine functions, axes, and complex logic, you can write tests that are more stable, maintainable, and reliable.
