# Lesson 2: Assessment

## Instructions

Read each question carefully and select the best answer. These questions are designed to test your understanding of the fundamental concepts of software testing.

---

### Question 1

Which level of testing is typically performed by developers to test the smallest, isolated parts of the code?

a) System Testing
b) Integration Testing
c) Unit Testing
d) Acceptance Testing

---

### Question 2

What does the testing principle "defects cluster together" imply?

a) Bugs are evenly distributed throughout the application.
b) A small number of modules are often responsible for most of the defects.
c) Once you find one bug, you should stop testing that area.
d) Testing should be avoided in areas where bugs have been found before.

---

### Question 3

In the V-Model, what development phase corresponds to System Testing?

a) Module Design
b) System Design
c) Requirements
d) Implementation (Coding)

---

### Question 4

Which of the following statements is a fundamental principle of testing?

a) It is possible to test a program completely and find all the defects.
b) Testing can prove that there are no defects in the software.
c) Early testing saves time and money.
d) Testing is not dependent on the context of the software.

---

### Question 5

What is the primary purpose of a test case?

a) To provide a vague idea of what to test.
b) To create a set of specific steps and conditions to verify a requirement, with a clear expected outcome.
c) To confuse the developer who has to fix the bug.
d) To be run only once and then discarded.

## Answer Key

1. **c) Unit Testing**
   - *Explanation: Unit testing focuses on the smallest components of the software in isolation and is primarily the responsibility of the developer.*

2. **b) A small number of modules are often responsible for most of the defects.**
   - *Explanation: This is the Pareto Principle (80/20 rule) applied to testing, suggesting that testing efforts can be focused on critical areas.*

3. **b) System Design**
   - *Explanation: The V-Model links the overall system design phase with the system testing phase, ensuring the complete system meets its design specifications.*

4. **c) Early testing saves time and money.**
   - *Explanation: This principle highlights the economic benefit of integrating testing throughout the SDLC, as defects are cheaper to fix when found early.*

5. **b) To create a set of specific steps and conditions to verify a requirement, with a clear expected outcome.**
   - *Explanation: A test case is a formal document that allows for consistent and repeatable verification of functionality.*
