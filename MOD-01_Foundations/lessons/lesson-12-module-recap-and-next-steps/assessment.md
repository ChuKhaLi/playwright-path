# Lesson 12: Assessment

## Instructions

Read each question carefully and select the best answer. These questions are designed to help you consolidate your knowledge from the entire module.

---

### Question 1

Which of the following best summarizes the core purpose of test automation?

a) To completely eliminate the need for manual testers.
b) To handle repetitive, predictable tests with speed and reliability, freeing up humans for more complex testing.
c) To make the software development process slower but more thorough.
d) To only test the user interface and ignore everything else.

---

### Question 2

The "Arrange-Act-Assert" pattern is an example of:

a) A type of non-functional testing.
b) A JavaScript event.
c) An industry best practice for structuring tests.
d) A way to install Playwright.

---

### Question 3

What is the relationship between HTML and the DOM (Document Object Model)?

a) They are two different names for the same thing.
b) The DOM is a styling language for HTML.
c) The browser parses the HTML to create the DOM, which is a tree-like structure of the page.
d) HTML is a programming language, while the DOM is a markup language.

---

### Question 4

You have set up a new Playwright project. What is the first thing you should do before writing your test logic in a new test file?

a) Import the `test` and `expect` functions from `@playwright/test`.
b) Run `npx playwright show-report`.
c) Choose a test runner like Jest or Mocha.
d) Write your test data in a separate file.

---

### Question 5

Based on the module recap, what is the primary focus of the next module in this course?

a) Advanced Playwright features.
b) API Testing.
c) Deeper exploration of the TypeScript programming language.
d) Mobile testing with Appium.

## Answer Key

1. **b) To handle repetitive, predictable tests with speed and reliability, freeing up humans for more complex testing.**
   - *Explanation: This captures the hybrid approach and the true value of automation in a modern QA strategy.*

2. **c) An industry best practice for structuring tests.**
   - *Explanation: The AAA pattern is a fundamental best practice for writing clean, readable, and maintainable tests.*

3. **c) The browser parses the HTML to create the DOM, which is a tree-like structure of the page.**
   - *Explanation: This is the crucial link. Your automation tool interacts with the DOM, not the raw HTML file.*

4. **a) Import the `test` and `expect` functions from `@playwright/test`.**
   - *Explanation: You must import the necessary building blocks from the Playwright library before you can use them to define and write your test.*

5. **c) Deeper exploration of the TypeScript programming language.**
   - *Explanation: The recap explicitly states that Module 2 will focus on strengthening your programming fundamentals with TypeScript.*
