# Lesson 5: QA Automation Career Paths - Hands-on Exercises

## Overview

These exercises are designed to help you explore potential career paths in QA automation, understand job market requirements, and begin planning your own professional development. This is about turning knowledge into a career strategy.

### Exercise 1: Analyzing Job Descriptions (Basic)

**Learning Objective:** To identify common skills, technologies, and responsibilities listed in real-world QA automation job descriptions.

**Prerequisites:**
- Access to a major job search website (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor).

**Instructions:**

1.  **Find three job postings:** Search for three different job postings for a "QA Automation Engineer" or "Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET)" role. Try to find one for a junior/entry-level position, one for a mid-level position, and one for a senior position.
2.  **Extract key information:** For each job description, create a list of the following:
    *   **Key Responsibilities:** What are the main duties of the role?
    *   **Required Programming Languages:** Which languages are mentioned most often?
    *   **Required Automation Tools/Frameworks:** Which specific tools (like Playwright, Selenium, Cypress) are listed?
    *   **Required Soft Skills:** What non-technical skills (like communication, teamwork, problem-solving) are mentioned?
3.  **Summarize your findings:** Write a short paragraph comparing the three roles. What are the biggest differences you notice between the junior, mid-level, and senior positions?

**Expected Outcome:**
A document summarizing the key requirements from three real job descriptions, along with a comparative analysis of the different seniority levels.

**Validation:**
- Have you identified the most frequently mentioned technologies and skills?
- Does your summary correctly identify how responsibilities grow with seniority (e.g., from writing tests to designing frameworks and mentoring)?

### Exercise 2: Self-Assessment and Skill Gap Analysis (Intermediate)

**Learning Objective:** To perform a personal skill gap analysis against the requirements of a desired QA automation role.

**Prerequisites:**
- Completion of Exercise 1.
- Honest self-reflection about your current skills.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Choose a target role:** Based on your research from Exercise 1, select one job description that represents a role you would like to have in the next 1-2 years (e.g., a mid-level QA Automation Engineer).
2.  **Create a skills table:** Make a table with four columns: `Required Skill/Technology`, `My Current Proficiency (1-5)`, `Evidence`, and `How I Will Improve`.
    *   `Proficiency Scale:` 1 = No knowledge, 2 = Basic awareness, 3 = Can use with guidance, 4 = Confident, 5 = Expert.
3.  **Populate the table:**
    *   In the first column, list the top 5-7 technical and soft skills from your chosen job description.
    *   In the second column, honestly rate your current proficiency for each skill.
    *   In the third column, provide brief evidence for your rating (e.g., "Completed a course," "Built a small project," "Used in a previous job").
    *   In the fourth column, for any skill you rated below a 4, write down one specific, actionable step you can take to improve it. (e.g., "Build a small Playwright project," "Read a book on test design," "Practice mock interviews").

**Expected Outcome:**
A personal skill gap analysis table that clearly shows where you stand in relation to a target job and outlines a concrete plan for improvement.

**Validation:**
- Is your self-assessment realistic?
- Are your improvement steps specific, measurable, and achievable?

### Exercise 3: Crafting a Personal Development Roadmap (Advanced/Challenge)

**Learning Objective:** To create a structured, timeline-based plan for achieving your career goals in QA automation.

**Prerequisites:**
- Completion of Exercise 2.
- Ability to set long-term goals and break them down into smaller steps.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Set a long-term goal:** Define where you want to be in your QA automation career in 3 years. Be specific. (e.g., "Become a Senior SDET specializing in performance testing," or "Lead a small team of automation engineers").
2.  **Create a 1-year roadmap:** Based on your 3-year goal and your skill gap analysis from Exercise 2, create a personal development roadmap for the next 12 months.
3.  **Structure the roadmap by quarters:** Divide your plan into four quarters (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4). For each quarter, define:
    *   **A Primary Focus:** What is the main theme for this quarter? (e.g., "Mastering Playwright," "Learning CI/CD," "Deepening API Testing Skills").
    *   **2-3 Key Learning Objectives:** What specific skills or knowledge will you acquire? (e.g., "Be able to build a POM framework from scratch," "Set up a GitHub Actions pipeline for a test suite").
    *   **A Tangible Project/Outcome:** What will you build or accomplish to prove you've learned it? (e.g., "Automate the test suite for a demo website," "Contribute a bug fix to an open-source tool," "Write a blog post explaining a concept").

**Expected Outcome:**
A clear, timeline-based personal development roadmap that breaks a long-term career goal into actionable quarterly steps.

**Validation:**
- Is the roadmap logical and progressive? Do the skills build on each other?
- Are the objectives for each quarter realistic and achievable?
- Does the roadmap directly address the gaps you identified in Exercise 2 and align with your long-term goal?
