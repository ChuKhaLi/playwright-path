## Answer Key

1. **b) Non-Functional Testing**
   - *Explanation: This is a form of performance testing (specifically, load testing), which is a non-functional requirement. It tests *how well* the system works, not *what* it does.*

2. **d) Unit Tests**
   - *Explanation: The Test Automation Pyramid advises having a large base of fast, reliable unit tests.*

3. **b) Black Box Testing**
   - *Explanation: In black box testing, the tester has no knowledge of the internal implementation and tests the system based on its requirements and specifications.*

4. **c) To determine if a new build is stable enough for further, more detailed testing.**
   - *Explanation: Smoke testing is a quick check of the major functions to ensure the build isn't fundamentally broken.*

5. **b) Re-running tests to ensure that new changes have not broken existing functionality.**
   - *Explanation: This is the definition of regression testing, a critical part of maintaining software quality over time.*
