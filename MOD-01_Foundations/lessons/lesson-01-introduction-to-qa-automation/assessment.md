## Answer Key

1. **b) A proactive process focused on preventing defects and ensuring quality throughout the development lifecycle.**
   - *Explanation: QA is about the entire process and preventing issues from happening in the first place.*

2. **c) To write scripts that perform repetitive tests automatically, increasing speed and reliability.**
   - *Explanation: Automation excels at handling repetitive tasks with speed and consistency.*

3. **d) It allows for fast and reliable regression testing.**
   - *Explanation: This is one of the most significant benefits, ensuring new code doesn't break existing functionality.*

4. **c) QA focuses on preventing defects (process-oriented), while QC focuses on identifying defects (product-oriented).**
   - *Explanation: This is the core distinction. QA is about the "how," and QC is about the "what."*

5. **b) Poor quality can lead to financial loss, security risks, and a bad user experience.**
   - *Explanation: The impact of poor quality is significant and affects both the business and its users.*
