# Lesson 1: Introduction to QA Automation - Hands-on Exercises

## Overview

These exercises are designed to reinforce the foundational concepts of QA automation. Since this is an introductory lesson, the exercises are focused on research, critical thinking, and understanding the role of automation in the real world.

### Exercise 1: Identifying Automation Candidates (Basic)

**Learning Objective:** To learn how to identify which testing tasks are good candidates for automation.

**Prerequisites:**
- Understanding of the difference between manual and automated testing.
- Access to the internet for research.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Choose a familiar application:** Think of a website or mobile app you use frequently (e.g., a social media app, an e-commerce site, a productivity tool).
2.  **List 5-7 common user actions:** Write down a list of tasks you regularly perform on the application.
    *   *Example for an e-commerce site:*
        *   User login
        *   Searching for a product
        *   Adding a product to the cart
        *   Proceeding to checkout
        *   Applying a discount code
        *   Signing up for a newsletter
3.  **Analyze for automation potential:** For each task, evaluate it against the following criteria and decide if it's a good candidate for automation.
    *   **Repetitive:** Is this a task that needs to be done over and over?
    *   **Time-consuming:** Does it take a long time to perform manually?
    *   **Prone to human error:** Is it easy to make a mistake while doing it manually?
    *   **Critical path:** Is this a critical feature that must always work? (e.g., login, checkout)
4.  **Create a table:** Summarize your findings in a table with the following columns: `Task`, `Good Candidate for Automation? (Yes/No)`, and `Justification`.

**Expected Outcome:**
A table that clearly identifies which tasks are suitable for automation and provides a brief, logical reason for each decision.

**Validation:**
- Does your justification for each task align with the core principles of when to automate?
- Have you identified at least two tasks that are good candidates and one that might not be?

### Exercise 2: Exploring Automation Tools (Intermediate)

**Learning Objective:** To gain awareness of the different types of test automation tools available in the market.

**Prerequisites:**
- Basic understanding of what a test automation framework is.
- Access to the internet.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Research three popular UI test automation tools:** Use a search engine to find three different tools used for automating web application tests. Some popular examples include Selenium, Cypress, and Playwright, but feel free to find others.
2.  **Gather key information:** For each tool, find the following information:
    *   The primary programming languages it supports.
    *   Whether it is open-source or a commercial product.
    *   One or two key features or selling points mentioned in its official documentation.
    *   A major company that reportedly uses it.
3.  **Summarize your findings:** Create a brief summary for each tool, presenting the information you gathered in a clear, organized format (e.g., using bullet points).

**Expected Outcome:**
A document containing a summary of three different UI automation tools, highlighting their key characteristics.

**Validation:**
- Is the information accurate and sourced from reliable places (like official websites or reputable tech blogs)?
- Does your summary clearly compare the key aspects of each tool?

### Exercise 3: The Value of Automation (Advanced/Challenge)

**Learning Objective:** To articulate the business value and ROI (Return on Investment) of test automation.

**Prerequisites:**
- Completion of the previous two exercises.
- Ability to think from a business or project manager's perspective.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Imagine a scenario:** You are a QA engineer at a startup that is about to launch a new e-commerce website. The development team is small, and the release schedule is aggressive. Currently, all testing is done manually.
2.  **Write a proposal:** Your task is to write a short proposal (2-3 paragraphs) to your manager arguing for the need to invest in test automation.
3.  **Include key arguments:** Your proposal should address the following points:
    *   **The problem:** Briefly describe the risks of relying solely on manual testing in this scenario (e.g., slow feedback, risk of bugs in production, QA team burnout).
    *   **The solution:** Explain how introducing test automation can help mitigate these risks.
    *   **The benefits (ROI):** Focus on the long-term benefits. How will automation save time and money in the future? How does it improve product quality and team efficiency? (Hint: Think about regression testing).
    *   **Recommendation:** Conclude with a clear recommendation to start implementing a test automation strategy.

**Expected Outcome:**
A persuasive, well-reasoned proposal that makes a strong case for adopting test automation from a business perspective.

**Validation:**
- Does the proposal clearly link technical benefits (e.g., faster tests) to business value (e.g., faster time-to-market, higher customer satisfaction)?
- Is the tone professional and persuasive?
- Does it successfully explain the concept of ROI in the context of automation?
