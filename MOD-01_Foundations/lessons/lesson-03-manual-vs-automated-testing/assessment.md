# Lesson 3: Assessment

## Instructions

Read each question carefully and select the best answer. These questions are designed to test your understanding of the differences between manual and automated testing.

---

### Question 1

Which of the following scenarios is BEST suited for manual testing?

a) Running the same login test with 1,000 different user credentials.
b) Checking that a new change hasn't broken any existing features in the application.
c) Performing exploratory testing on a brand-new feature to check its usability and user-friendliness.
d) Simulating 5,000 users accessing the website at the same time.

---

### Question 2

What is a primary advantage of automated testing?

a) It has a very low upfront cost.
b) It is excellent for testing the look and feel of a user interface.
c) It is fast, reliable, and perfect for repetitive regression tests.
d) It requires no maintenance once the scripts are written.

---

### Question 3

A "hybrid approach" to testing refers to:

a) Only using manual testing.
b) Only using automated testing.
c) Using a combination of both manual and automated testing to leverage the strengths of each.
d) A new type of testing that has not been covered yet.

---

### Question 4

What is a significant disadvantage of manual testing?

a) It is too fast to catch complex bugs.
b) It is prone to human error, especially with repetitive tasks.
c) It requires expensive software tools to get started.
d) It cannot be used to test new features.

---

### Question 5

Regression testing is an ideal candidate for automation because:

a) It is performed only once in a project's lifetime.
b) It involves creative and intuitive exploration of the application.
c) It involves running a large suite of repeatable tests to ensure existing functionality still works.
d) It is focused on the application's visual design.

## Answer Key

1. **c) Performing exploratory testing on a brand-new feature to check its usability and user-friendliness.**
   - *Explanation: This type of testing requires human intuition and creativity, which are strengths of manual testing.*

2. **c) It is fast, reliable, and perfect for repetitive regression tests.**
   - *Explanation: Speed, reliability, and handling repetition are the core strengths of automation.*

3. **c) Using a combination of both manual and automated testing to leverage the strengths of each.**
   - *Explanation: A hybrid strategy is the most effective and common approach in modern QA.*

4. **b) It is prone to human error, especially with repetitive tasks.**
   - *Explanation: Humans can get tired or distracted during repetitive tasks, leading to mistakes that automation avoids.*

5. **c) It involves running a large suite of repeatable tests to ensure existing functionality still works.**
   - *Explanation: This is the definition of regression testing, and its repetitive, predictable nature makes it perfect for automation.*
