## Section B: Code Analysis and Debugging (15 points)

### Question 1: Specificity Analysis (5 points)
Given these CSS rules, what color will the paragraph text be?

```css
p { color: black; }                    /* Rule 1 */
.content p { color: blue; }            /* Rule 2 */
#main .content p { color: red; }       /* Rule 3 */
p.highlight { color: green; }          /* Rule 4 */
```

```html
<div id="main">
    <div class="content">
        <p class="highlight">What color is this text?</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

**Answer**: Red. Rule 3 has the highest specificity (111: 1 ID + 1 class + 1 element).

### Question 2: Selector Debugging (5 points)
This CSS is intended to style all buttons inside form elements, but it's not working. Identify and fix the issue:

```css
/* Intended: Style all buttons inside forms */
form > button {
    background-color: blue;
    color: white;
}
```

```html
<form>
    <div class="form-group">
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </div>
</form>
```

**Problem**: The `>` child selector only targets direct children. The button is nested inside a div.

**Solution**: 
```css
/* Use descendant selector instead */
form button {
    background-color: blue;
    color: white;
}
```

### Question 3: Multiple Class Analysis (5 points)
Explain what each of these selectors would target:

```css
.btn.primary { }        /* A */
.btn .primary { }       /* B */
.btn + .primary { }     /* C */
.btn, .primary { }      /* D */
```

**Expected Answers**:
- A: Elements with both "btn" AND "primary" classes
- B: Elements with "primary" class that are descendants of "btn" class elements
- C: Elements with "primary" class that are immediately after "btn" class elements
- D: Elements with EITHER "btn" OR "primary" class (or both)

## Section C: Practical Implementation (10 points)

### Task: Create a Navigation Menu with Advanced Selectors

Write CSS using only selectors (no additional classes) to style this navigation menu according to the requirements:

```html
<nav class="main-nav">
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#home" class="active">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="#services">Services</a></li>
        <li><a href="#contact" class="external">Contact</a></li>
    </ul>
    <div class="nav-toggle">
        <button type="button">Menu</button>
    </div>
</nav>
```

**Requirements** (2 points each):
1. Remove bullet points from all list items in the navigation
2. Make all links inside the navigation white with no underline
3. Give the active link a different background color
4. Add an arrow icon (→) after external links using pseudo-elements
5. Style the button inside nav-toggle with a border and padding

**Expected Solution** (10 points total):

```css
/* Remove bullet points from nav list items */
.main-nav ul {
    list-style: none;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
}

/* Style all links inside navigation */
.main-nav a {
    color: white;
    text-decoration: none;
    display: block;
    padding: 10px 15px;
}

/* Style active link */
.main-nav a.active {
    background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
}

/* Add arrow to external links */
.main-nav a.external::after {
    content: " →";
    margin-left: 5px;
}

/* Style button inside nav-toggle */
.main-nav .nav-toggle button {
    border: 2px solid white;
    padding: 8px 16px;
    background: transparent;
    color: white;
}
```

**Grading Criteria**:
- Correct selector usage (5 points)
- Meeting all requirements (4 points)  
- Clean, maintainable code (1 point)

## Common Mistakes and Learning Points

### Specificity Misunderstandings
**Common Error**: Thinking classes always override elements
**Learning Point**: Specificity is calculated mathematically: IDs (100) > Classes (10) > Elements (1)

**Example**:
```css
p { color: red; }           /* Specificity: 1 */
.text { color: blue; }      /* Specificity: 10 - wins */
```

### Combinator Confusion
**Common Error**: Confusing descendant (space) and child (>) selectors
**Learning Point**: 
- `div p` - All p elements inside div (at any level)
- `div > p` - Only direct p children of div

### Multiple Class Syntax
**Common Error**: Writing `.btn .primary` instead of `.btn.primary`
**Learning Point**:
- `.btn .primary` - Elements with "primary" class inside "btn" elements
- `.btn.primary` - Elements with BOTH classes

### Pseudo-Class vs Pseudo-Element
**Common Error**: Using `:before` instead of `::before`
**Learning Point**: Modern CSS uses `::` for pseudo-elements and `:` for pseudo-classes

### Testing Selector Stability
**Common Error**: Using position-dependent selectors like `:nth-child(3)`
**Learning Point**: Use semantic attributes like `data-testid` for reliable testing

- Complete additional exercises with multiple class combinations

**Additional Practice**:
```css
/* Practice these selector patterns */
.parent > .child          /* Direct child */
.parent .descendant       /* Any descendant */
.class1.class2           /* Multiple classes */
.parent .child:hover     /* Pseudo-class combination */
```

### Score 24-31 points (48-63%)
**Focus Areas**: Basic selector types, CSS syntax, selector combinations

**Required Actions**:
- Re-read lesson content sections 1-6
- Complete Exercise 01 again with careful attention to syntax

## Advanced Application: Testing Context

### CSS Selectors in Automated Testing

This assessment has prepared you to understand how CSS selectors are used in testing frameworks:

**Playwright Examples**:
```javascript
// These selectors from your assessment translate directly to testing
await page.click('[data-testid="submit-btn"]');        // Attribute selector
await page.locator('.btn.primary').click();            // Multiple classes
await page.locator('form button[type="submit"]');      // Descendant + attribute
```

**Best Practices for Testing**:
1. **Prefer data-testid attributes** - Most stable and explicit
2. **Use semantic class names** - More maintainable than positional selectors
3. **Avoid deep nesting** - Keep selectors simple and readable
4. **Consider selector stability** - Avoid selectors that break with UI changes

### Real-World Applications

The selectors you've learned are essential for:
- **Web Development**: Creating maintainable, scalable CSS
- **QA Automation**: Reliably identifying elements for testing
- **Debugging**: Understanding how styles are applied
- **Performance**: Writing efficient CSS that browsers can parse quickly
