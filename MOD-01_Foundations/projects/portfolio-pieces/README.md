# Portfolio Pieces for Module 1

This directory is a space for you to create smaller, focused projects that demonstrate specific skills you learned in Module 1. Unlike the guided `module-project`, this is a space for your own exploration.

## Ideas for Portfolio Pieces

Based on the lessons in this module, here are some ideas for projects you could create and add here.

### 1. A "Perfect" HTML Form
-   **Concept:** Create a single HTML page with a complex form that uses a wide variety of input types (`text`, `password`, `checkbox`, `radio`, `dropdown`, `textarea`).
-   **Skills Demonstrated:** HTML structure, form elements, accessibility (using `<label>` tags correctly), and readiness for automation (using clear `id` and `name` attributes).

### 2. An Advanced Selector Cheat Sheet
-   **Concept:** Create a well-structured HTML page that contains many difficult-to-select elements. Then, create a corresponding `selectors.md` file that lists each element and provides a robust CSS and XPath selector for it.
-   **Skills Demonstrated:** Deep understanding of CSS and XPath, including advanced axes and functions.

### 3. An API Analysis Document
-   **Concept:** Choose a public API (like the [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/) or the [Studio Ghibli API](https://ghibliapi.vercel.app/)) and analyze one or two of its endpoints.
-   **Skills Demonstrated:** Use of DevTools or Postman, understanding of HTTP requests/responses, and ability to read and analyze JSON. Document your findings in a `api_analysis.md` file.

Feel free to add your own projects here as you continue to learn and grow.
