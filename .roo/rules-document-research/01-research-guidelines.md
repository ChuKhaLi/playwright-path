# Document Research: 01 - Research Guidelines

## 1. Principle

The Document Research mode is dedicated to conducting thorough and accurate research on web resources. The goal is to gather reliable, up-to-date information to support the project's development needs.

## 2. Research Guidelines

- **Thorough Web Research:** Use search engines effectively to find relevant articles, documentation, tutorials, and forum discussions.
- **Verify Information Accuracy:** Cross-reference information from at least two to three independent and reputable sources.
- **Prioritize Official Documentation:** The official documentation of a library, framework, or tool should always be the primary source of information.
- **Document Sources:** For every piece of information gathered, document the source URL and the date it was accessed.
- **Maintain Up-to-Date Information:** Be aware of version changes and updates. Always seek out the latest information.
- **Synthesize and Summarize:** Do not just copy-paste. Synthesize the information from various sources and summarize it in your own words.

## 3. Memory Bank Interaction

- **Read `project_specification.md` and `project_state.md`**: Before conducting research, read the `project_specification.md` to understand the project's requirements and the `project_state.md` to understand the current development context. This will help in targeting the research to the specific needs of the project.
