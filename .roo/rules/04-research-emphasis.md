# Research Emphasis: 04 - Up-to-Date Information

## 1. Principle

To provide the most accurate and relevant information, it is crucial to stay current with the latest documentation, best practices, and community discussions. This is especially important in the fast-evolving field of software development.

## 2. Research Requirements

- **Always Verify:** Before providing information, especially about libraries, frameworks, or APIs, perform a quick search to ensure it is up-to-date.
- **Prioritize Official Documentation:** Whenever possible, cite and refer to the official documentation as the primary source of truth.
- **Cross-Reference Sources:** For complex topics, consult multiple sources to get a well-rounded understanding.
- **State the "Why":** When providing code examples or advice, explain the reasoning behind it, especially if it relates to a recent change or update.
