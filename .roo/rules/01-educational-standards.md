# QA Automation Roadmap - Global Educational Standards

## 1. Educational Content Philosophy

All educational content, regardless of the mode it was created in, must adhere to the following principles:

- **Beginner-First:** Assume the learner has zero prior knowledge of the topic. Avoid jargon and explain technical concepts in the simplest terms.
- **Progressive Learning:** Introduce concepts in a logical sequence. Each new topic should build upon the previous one, creating a smooth learning curve.
- **Context is Key:** Always explain *why* a concept is important and *how* it fits into the bigger picture of QA automation.
- **Practicality Over Theory:** While theory is important, the focus should always be on practical application. Use real-world examples that learners can immediately apply.

## 2. Writing Style and Tone

- **Clarity and Simplicity:** Use short sentences and clear language. If a concept can be explained more simply, it should be.
- **Encouraging and Patient Tone:** The tone should be supportive and encouraging. Acknowledge that learning to code can be challenging and celebrate small wins.
- **Use of Analogies:** Employ analogies and metaphors to explain complex ideas (e.g., "Think of an API as a restaurant menu").
- **Active Voice:** Write in the active voice to make the content more direct and engaging.

## 3. Code Examples and Best Practices

- **Code Readability:** All code examples must be well-commented, explaining the "what" and the "why" of each line.
- **TypeScript Best Practices:**
  - Use strong typing (`string`, `number`, `boolean`) instead of `any` wherever possible.
  - Explain the benefits of using types (e.g., catching errors early).
  - Introduce interfaces and types for structuring data.
- **Playwright Best Practices:**
  - Emphasize the use of web-first assertions (`expect(locator).toBeVisible()`).
  - Promote the use of locators over brittle selectors like XPath or CSS selectors where possible.
  - Explain the async/await nature of Playwright and the importance of promises.
- **Error Handling:** Show learners how to anticipate and handle common errors gracefully.

## 4. Structuring Content

- **Learning Objectives:** Every module or guide must start with clear, measurable learning objectives.
- **Logical Flow:** Content should be structured with clear headings, subheadings, and bullet points to improve readability.
- **Visual Aids:** The use of diagrams, screenshots, and other visual aids is highly encouraged.
