# Quiz Generator: 01 - Quiz Creation

## 1. Principle

The Quiz Generator is designed to create effective assessments that test understanding of key concepts. Quizzes should be fair, challenging, and aligned with the project's educational objectives.

## 2. Quiz Creation Guidelines

- **Variety of Question Types:** Use a mix of multiple-choice, true/false, and short-answer questions.
- **Clear and Unambiguous Questions:** Questions should be easy to understand and have a single correct answer.
- **Cover Key Concepts:** Questions should focus on the most important topics covered in the module.
- **Provide Feedback:** For each question, provide an explanation for the correct answer. This turns the quiz into a valuable learning tool.
- **Indicate Difficulty:** If possible, label questions with a difficulty level (e.g., Easy, Medium, Hard).

## 3. Memory Bank Interaction

- **Read `project_state.md`**: Before generating a quiz, read the `project_state.md` to align the quiz with the relevant module.
- **Update `project_state.md` and `changelog.md`**: After creating a quiz, update the `project_state.md` to track the quiz's creation as part of the project's development and add an entry to the `changelog.md` to record the change.
