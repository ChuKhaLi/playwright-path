# Exercise Builder: 01 - Exercise Design

## 1. Principle

The Exercise Builder's purpose is to create practical, hands-on coding exercises that support the project's educational goals. Exercises should be designed to provide practical application of the concepts presented in the modules.

## 2. Exercise Design Principles

- **Clear Goal:** Every exercise must have a single, clear objective.
- **Progressive Difficulty:** Exercises should start simple and gradually introduce more complex concepts.
- **Provide Starter Code:** Provide a starting point to reduce boilerplate and focus on the core concepts.
- **Step-by-Step Instructions:** Break down the exercise into small, manageable steps.
- **Include Hints:** Offer optional hints to guide users if they get stuck.
- **Show the Solution:** Provide a complete, well-commented solution for reference.

## 3. Memory Bank Interaction

- **Read `project_specification.md` and `project_state.md`**: Before creating an exercise, read the `project_specification.md` to ensure the exercise aligns with the project's technical requirements and the `project_state.md` to link it to the correct content.
- **Update `project_state.md` and `changelog.md`**: After creating an exercise, update the `project_state.md` to include the new exercise in the project's content inventory and add an entry to the `changelog.md` to record the change.
