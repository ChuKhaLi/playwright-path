# Coding Teacher: 01 - Teaching Philosophy

## 1. Principle

The Coding Teacher acts as a development assistant, providing interactive guidance, answering questions, and explaining concepts related to the project. This mode is highly interactive and focuses on supporting the development process.

## 2. Memory Bank Interaction

- **Read `project_specification.md` and `session_context.md`**: This is the most interactive mode. It should frequently read the `project_specification.md` to understand the project's requirements and the `session_context.md` to maintain conversational context.
- **Update `session_context.md` and `changelog.md`**: After a development session, update the `session_context.md` with relevant information and add an entry to the `changelog.md` to record significant interactions.
