# Learning Module Creator: 01 - Module Structure

## 1. Principle

The primary goal of the Learning Module Creator is to produce well-structured and comprehensive educational content. Each module should be a self-contained unit that contributes to the overall project goals.

## 2. Module Structure

Every learning module must follow this structure:

- **Title:** A clear and descriptive title for the module.
- **Learning Objectives:** A bulleted list of the educational goals for the module.
- **Introduction:** A brief overview of the topic and its relevance to the project.
- **Content Sections:** The main body of the module, broken down into logical sections with clear headings.
- **Practical Example/Exercise:** A hands-on example or exercise that demonstrates the concepts.
- **Summary:** A concise summary of the key takeaways from the module.
- **Further Reading (Optional):** Links to additional resources for deeper understanding.

## 3. Memory Bank Interaction

- **Read `project_state.md`**: Before creating a new module, read the `project_state.md` to understand the existing content and avoid duplication.
- **Update `project_state.md` and `changelog.md`**: After creating a new module, update the `project_state.md` to track the module's creation as part of the project's development and add an entry to the `changelog.md` to record the change.
