## Common Reporting Patterns

Throughout these examples, you'll encounter several recurring patterns:

### **Multi-Reporter Architecture**
```javascript
// cucumber.js configuration pattern
module.exports = {
  default: {
    format: [
      'html:reports/cucumber-report.html',
      'json:reports/cucumber-report.json',
      'junit:reports/cucumber-report.xml',
      '@cucumber/pretty-formatter'
    ],
    // Additional configuration
  }
};
```

### **Custom Data Processing Pipeline**
```javascript
// Report generation pattern
const reportOptions = {
  theme: 'bootstrap',
  jsonFile: 'reports/cucumber-report.json',
  output: 'reports/cucumber-report.html',
  reportSuiteAsScenarios: true,
  launchReport: true
};
```

### **Template Customization Pattern**
```javascript
// Custom template processing
const customTemplate = {
  brandingHtml: '<div class="custom-branding">Company Logo</div>',
  customData: {
    buildInfo: process.env.BUILD_INFO,
    environment: process.env.NODE_ENV
  }
};
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### **Report Generation Failures**
```bash
# Check dependencies
npm ls cucumber-html-reporter

# Verify file permissions
ls -la reports/

# Test with minimal configuration
npx cucumber-js --format json:test.json
```

#### **Template Customization Issues**
```bash
# Validate JSON structure
npx jsonlint reports/cucumber-report.json

# Check template syntax
# Use online Handlebars validators

# Test incremental changes
# Start with basic template, add features gradually
```

#### **Real-time Integration Problems**
```bash
# Check WebSocket connections
# Use browser developer tools

# Verify API endpoints
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/reports/status

# Monitor resource usage
# Check memory and CPU utilization
```
