## Lesson Overview

Living documentation represents one of the most powerful benefits of Behavior-Driven Development. Unlike traditional documentation that quickly becomes outdated, living documentation automatically reflects the current state of your system, providing stakeholders with always-current insights into system behavior, test coverage, and quality metrics.

### What You'll Build

**📊 Multi-Format Reports**
- Interactive HTML reports with advanced filtering and search
- PDF executive summaries for stakeholder distribution
- JSON data feeds for custom integrations
- XML reports for CI/CD pipeline integration

**📈 Real-time Dashboards**
- Live test execution monitoring
- Historical trend analysis
- Coverage and quality metrics
- Performance tracking and alerting

**🔄 Automated Distribution**
- Scheduled report generation
- Email and Slack notifications
- Cloud storage integration
- Version-controlled documentation
