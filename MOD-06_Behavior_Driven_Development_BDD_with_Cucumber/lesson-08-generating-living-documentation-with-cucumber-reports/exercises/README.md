## Setup Instructions

### 1. Initial Project Setup

```bash
# Clone or navigate to your project directory
cd your-cucumber-project

# Install required dependencies
npm install --save-dev @cucumber/cucumber @playwright/test
npm install --save-dev multiple-cucumber-html-reporter handlebars

# Create directory structure
mkdir -p reports/{json,html,custom}
mkdir -p templates/{executive,developer,qa}
mkdir -p dashboard/{css,js,assets}
```

### 2. Basic Configuration

Create the following configuration files:

**cucumber.js**
```javascript
module.exports = {
  default: {
    format: [
      '@cucumber/pretty-formatter',
      'json:reports/json/cucumber-report.json',
      'html:reports/html/cucumber-report.html'
    ],
    paths: ['features/**/*.feature'],
    require: ['step-definitions/**/*.ts'],
    requireModule: ['ts-node/register']
  }
};
```

**package.json scripts**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:cucumber": "cucumber-js",
    "test:reports": "cucumber-js && npm run generate:reports",
    "generate:reports": "node scripts/generate-reports.js"
  }
}
```

### 3. Sample Test Data

Create sample feature files and step definitions to generate test data:

**features/sample.feature**
```gherkin
Feature: Sample Feature for Report Generation
  As a QA engineer
  I want to generate sample test data
  So that I can practice report generation

  @smoke @priority-high
  Scenario: Successful login
    Given I am on the login page
    When I enter valid credentials
    Then I should be logged in successfully

  @regression @priority-medium  
  Scenario: Invalid login attempt
    Given I am on the login page
    When I enter invalid credentials
    Then I should see an error message
```
