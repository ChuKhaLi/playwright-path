# MOD-06: Behavior Driven Development (BDD) with Cucumber

## 📚 Module Overview

This module introduces Behavior Driven Development (BDD) and how to implement it using Cucumber with Playwright and TypeScript. It focuses on writing human-readable specifications that can be automated as tests, fostering collaboration between technical and non-technical team members.

### 🎯 Learning Outcomes

By completing this module, you will:
- Understand the core principles of BDD and its benefits.
- Write clear and effective feature files using the Gherkin syntax.
- Set up a BDD testing framework with Cucumber, TypeScript, and Playwright.
- Implement step definitions to connect Gherkin steps with automation code.
- Pass data from feature files to step definitions, including using data tables.
- Utilize Cucumber hooks and tags to manage test execution and setup/teardown.
- Integrate the Page Object Model (POM) with Cucumber for maintainable tests.
- Generate living documentation from your feature files and test results.
- Manage test data effectively within a BDD framework.

### ⏱️ Duration & Commitment

- **Total Duration**: 4-5 weeks
- **Time Commitment**: 12-15 hours per week
- **Total Lessons**: 10 comprehensive lessons
- **Prerequisites**: Completion of MOD-E2E-01 and MOD-02.
