**Prerequisites:** MOD-01, MOD-02, MOD-E2E-01, MOD-03, MOD-04  

## Learning Path Integration

This module builds upon foundational testing concepts and Page Object Model patterns to introduce collaborative testing methodologies using BDD and Cucumber.js with TypeScript and Playwright integration.

**Prerequisite Knowledge:**
- TypeScript fundamentals (MOD-01)
- Testing fundamentals and async/await (MOD-02) 
- Playwright E2E testing basics (MOD-E2E-01)
- Advanced Playwright patterns (MOD-03)
- Page Object Model implementation (MOD-04)

**Prepares for:**
- Advanced testing patterns and frameworks
- Team collaboration and living documentation practices
- Enterprise-level test automation strategies

## Technical Specifications

**Core Technologies:**
- Cucumber.js (`@cucumber/cucumber`)
- Gherkin language specification
- TypeScript integration with step definitions
- Playwright integration for BDD scenarios
- Living documentation generation

**Development Environment:**
- Node.js with TypeScript support
- Windows compatibility (PowerShell commands)
- Integration with existing Playwright projects
- Visual Studio Code with Cucumber extensions

## Module Structure

**Total Lessons:** 12  
**Assessment Framework:** Knowledge checks + hands-on exercises per lesson  
**Final Project:** Complete BDD implementation for e-commerce testing scenario  

### Lesson Distribution:
1. **Foundation Lessons (1-3):** BDD concepts, setup, Gherkin syntax
2. **Implementation Lessons (4-7):** Step definitions, data handling, hooks, POM integration  
3. **Advanced Lessons (8-11):** Reports, complex scenarios, test data, debugging
4. **Synthesis Lesson (12):** Best practices and module recap
