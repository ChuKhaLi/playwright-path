# Lesson 06: Using Cucumber Hooks and Tags

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

1. **LO1**: Implement all types of Cucumber hooks (Before/After, BeforeAll/AfterAll, BeforeStep/AfterStep) in TypeScript
2. **LO2**: Create conditional hooks using tag expressions for targeted test execution
3. **LO3**: Design and apply comprehensive tag strategies for test organization and execution
4. **LO4**: Execute tests selectively using command-line tag filtering and environment variables
5. **LO5**: Integrate hooks with Playwright for robust browser lifecycle management
6. **LO6**: Implement advanced debugging and monitoring workflows using hooks and tags

## Introduction

Hooks and tags are powerful mechanisms in Cucumber that provide fine-grained control over test execution and enable sophisticated test organization strategies. This lesson explores how to leverage these features to create maintainable, efficient, and flexible BDD test suites.

**Why Hooks and Tags Matter:**
- **Lifecycle Management**: Control setup and teardown at multiple levels
- **Conditional Execution**: Run specific subsets of tests based on context
- **Environmental Flexibility**: Adapt test behavior across different environments
- **Team Collaboration**: Organize tests by feature, team, or development status
- **Performance Optimization**: Skip expensive operations when not needed

## Lesson Structure

### ðŸ“š **Core Content Sections**

1. **Hook Fundamentals**
   - Hook types and execution order
   - TypeScript implementation patterns
   - Scenario object access and state management

2. **Tag Strategy and Organization**
   - Tag naming conventions and hierarchies
   - Functional vs. organizational tagging
   - Tag expression syntax and boolean logic

3. **Conditional Execution Patterns**
   - Tag-based hook targeting
   - Command-line filtering techniques
   - Environment variable configuration

4. **Integration with Playwright**
   - Browser lifecycle management
   - Screenshot capture and debugging
   - Performance monitoring and optimization

### ðŸ”§ **Hands-On Components**

- **Examples**: 4 comprehensive examples demonstrating hook types, tag strategies, conditional execution, and Playwright integration
- **Exercises**: 4 progressive workshops from basic hook implementation to advanced tag-based testing strategies
- **Visual Aids**: Interactive diagrams showing hook execution flow and tag filtering logic
- **Assessment**: Comprehensive evaluation covering both theoretical knowledge and practical implementation skills

### ðŸŽ¯ **Key Technologies**

- **[@cucumber/cucumber](./examples/01-hook-fundamentals.md:45)**: Hook definitions and tag filtering
- **TypeScript**: Async/await patterns and type safety
- **Playwright**: Browser automation and lifecycle management
- **Command Line**: Tag filtering and execution control
