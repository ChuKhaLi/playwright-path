## Getting Started

### Environment Setup

1. **Clone the Exercise Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd lesson-09-exercises
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Verify Setup**
   ```bash
   npm run test:setup
   ```

### Exercise Progression

We recommend completing the exercises in order:

1. **Start with Exercise 01** to build foundational advanced Gherkin skills
2. **Progress to Exercise 02** to master complex data handling
3. **Continue with Exercise 03** to learn organizational patterns
4. **Finish with Exercise 04** for the most comprehensive challenge

### Submission Guidelines

For each exercise:

1. **Implementation Files**: Include all feature files, step definitions, and supporting code
2. **Documentation**: Provide README with setup and execution instructions
3. **Test Results**: Include screenshots or logs showing successful test execution
4. **Reflection**: Write a brief reflection on challenges faced and lessons learned

## Assessment Criteria

Your exercises will be evaluated on:
