## Key Concepts Covered

### Background Sections
```gherkin
Background:
  Given the system is initialized with default configuration
  And the user authentication service is available
  And the database contains baseline test data
```

### Scenario Outlines with Complex Data
```gherkin
Scenario Outline: Complex user registration validation
  Given a user with the following details:
    | field        | value        |
    | email        | <email>      |
    | password     | <password>   |
    | preferences  | <prefs>      |
  When they attempt to register
  Then the system should <action>
  And the response should contain <message>

Examples:
  | email           | password | prefs                    | action | message        |
  | valid@test.com  | Pass123! | {"theme":"dark"}         | accept | success        |
  | invalid-email   | Pass123! | {"theme":"light"}        | reject | invalid_email  |
```

### Advanced Data Tables
```gherkin
Given the following product catalog:
  | category | product    | price | availability | variants            |
  | books    | Novel      | 19.99 | in_stock     | hardcover,ebook     |
  | books    | Biography  | 24.99 | limited      | hardcover           |
  | tech     | Laptop     | 999.0 | pre_order    | 13inch,15inch,17inch|
```

### Sophisticated Tagging
```gherkin
@critical @smoke @authentication @api @regression
Scenario: User login with multi-factor authentication
  # Scenario implementation
```

### Conditional Business Logic
```gherkin
Scenario: Order processing with complex business rules
  Given a customer with loyalty tier "platinum"
  And they have a cart with items totaling $150
  When they apply promotion code "SAVE20"
  Then if their order qualifies for free shipping
    And the discount should be applied as 20% off
    And shipping cost should be $0
  But if they are in a restricted region
    Then the promotion should be invalid
    And they should see a location-based message
```

## Advanced Patterns

### 1. Data Transformation Patterns
Learn how to work with complex data structures and transform them effectively in step definitions.

### 2. Dynamic Scenario Generation  
Explore techniques for creating scenarios that adapt to different contexts and environments.

### 3. Cross-Feature Dependencies
Handle scenarios that span multiple features or require coordination between different parts of the system.

### 4. Performance and Load Testing Scenarios
Apply BDD principles to performance testing and load validation scenarios.
