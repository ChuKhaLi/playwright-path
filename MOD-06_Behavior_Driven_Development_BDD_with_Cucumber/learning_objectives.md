# MOD-06: Behavior Driven Development (BDD) with Cucumber - Learning Objectives

## Module-Level Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, learners will be able to:

1. **Implement BDD Methodology:** Apply Behavior Driven Development principles to bridge communication gaps between technical and non-technical stakeholders in test automation projects.

2. **Master Gherkin Language:** Write clear, maintainable, and business-readable feature files using Gherkin syntax that accurately represent business requirements and user scenarios.

3. **Create TypeScript Step Definitions:** Define robust step definitions in TypeScript that connect Gherkin scenarios to executable code using Playwright for web automation.

4. **Integrate with Existing Frameworks:** Successfully integrate Cucumber.js with existing Playwright and Page Object Model architectures without disrupting established patterns.

5. **Generate Living Documentation:** Produce automatic documentation from executable specifications that serves as both test suite and business requirements documentation.
