## Part 1: Theory Check (25 minutes, 20%)

### **Section A: Multiple Choice Questions (15 minutes)**

**Instructions**: Select the best answer for each question. Each question is worth 2 points.

#### **Question 1**: TypeScript Step Definition Fundamentals
Which of the following step definition signatures demonstrates proper TypeScript typing for a parameter with custom validation?

A) `Given('I login as {string}', async function (username) { ... })`
B) `Given('I login as {string}', async function (username: string) { ... })`
C) `Given('I login as {user}', async function (user: UserCredentials) { ... })`
D) `Given('I login as {any}', async function (user: any) { ... })`

**Correct Answer**: C  
**Explanation**: Custom parameter types provide the strongest typing and validation capabilities.

#### **Question 2**: Async/Await Patterns in Step Definitions
What is the primary advantage of using async/await in step definitions over callback patterns?

A) Better performance in all scenarios
B) Simpler error handling and sequential operation flow
C) Automatic parameter validation
D) Built-in retry mechanisms

**Correct Answer**: B  
**Explanation**: Async/await provides cleaner, more readable code with better error handling for sequential operations.

#### **Question 3**: Parameter Processing Priority
When Cucumber encounters a step with multiple possible parameter matches, how does it determine which parameter type to use?

A) First registered parameter type wins
B) Most specific regex pattern wins
C) Alphabetical order of parameter type names
D) Random selection with fallback to string

**Correct Answer**: B  
**Explanation**: Cucumber uses the most specific regex pattern match to determine parameter type precedence.

#### **Question 4**: Error Handling Best Practices
In professional BDD automation, what is the most appropriate approach for handling intermittent network failures?

A) Fail immediately and report the error
B) Retry indefinitely until success
C) Implement exponential backoff with maximum retry limits
D) Skip the test and mark it as pending

**Correct Answer**: C  
**Explanation**: Exponential backoff with limits provides resilience while preventing infinite loops.

#### **Question 5**: Page Object Integration
What is the primary benefit of using Page Object Model patterns within step definitions?

A) Faster test execution
B) Separation of business logic from technical implementation
C) Automatic error handling
D) Built-in parameter validation

**Correct Answer**: B  
**Explanation**: POM separates business logic (step definitions) from technical implementation details (page interactions).

### **Section B: Short Answer Questions (10 minutes)**

**Instructions**: Provide concise but complete answers. Each question is worth 5 points.

#### **Question 6**: Custom Parameter Types (5 minutes)
Explain the process of creating a custom parameter type for handling "flexible dates" (e.g., "today", "next week", "2024-12-25"). Include the key components required and one potential challenge.

**Expected Answer Points**:
- Use `defineParameterType()` function
- Define name, regexp, and transformer function
- Handle multiple date formats in transformer
- Challenge: Time zone handling or date parsing edge cases
- Example implementation showing pattern matching

#### **Question 7**: World Object Usage (5 minutes)
Describe how the World object enables state sharing between step definitions and provide an example of when this would be necessary in a real-world testing scenario.

**Expected Answer Points**:
- World object maintains state across steps within a scenario
- Shared through `this` context in step definitions
- Example: User login credentials, test data, or page instances
- State is reset between scenarios for isolation
- Enables complex multi-step workflows

## Part 2: Code Analysis (20 minutes, 15%)

### **Section A: Debug the Step Definition (10 minutes, 10 points)**

**Instructions**: Identify and fix the issues in the following step definition code.

```typescript
Given('I create a user with name {string} and email {string}', function (name, email) {
  const userData = {
    name: name,
    email: email,
    created: new Date()
  };
  
  this.page.goto('/users/new');
  this.page.fill('#name', userData.name);
  this.page.fill('#email', userData.email);
  this.page.click('#submit');
  
  this.lastCreatedUser = userData;
});
```

**Issues to Identify**:
1. Missing async/await keywords
2. Missing TypeScript parameter types
3. Missing proper error handling
4. No wait conditions for page interactions
5. No verification of successful creation

**Corrected Version**:
```typescript
Given('I create a user with name {string} and email {string}', async function (name: string, email: string) {
  const userData = {
    name: name,
    email: email,
    created: new Date()
  };
  
  await this.page!.goto('/users/new');
  await this.page!.waitForLoadState('networkidle');
  
  await this.page!.fill('#name', userData.name);
  await this.page!.fill('#email', userData.email);
  await this.page!.click('#submit');
  
  // Wait for success confirmation
  await this.page!.waitForSelector('[data-testid="success-message"]');
  
  this.lastCreatedUser = userData;
});
```

### **Section B: Code Review Questions (10 minutes, 5 points)**

**Instructions**: Answer the following questions about the corrected code.

#### **Question 8**: Why is the `!` operator used with `this.page!`?

**Expected Answer**: The `!` operator is a TypeScript non-null assertion operator. It tells TypeScript that `page` is guaranteed to be non-null at runtime, even though the type system can't verify this statically.

#### **Question 9**: What would happen if we didn't include `waitForLoadState('networkidle')`?

**Expected Answer**: The test might attempt to interact with elements before the page is fully loaded, leading to element not found errors or flaky test behavior due to race conditions.

## Part 3: Practical Implementation (60 minutes, 50%)

### **Task 1: Basic Step Definition Implementation (20 minutes, 15 points)**

**Scenario**: You need to implement step definitions for a task management application.

**Requirements**: Implement the following step definitions with proper TypeScript typing:

```gherkin
Given I am logged in as a "manager" user
When I create a task with title "Review code" and priority "high"
Then I should see the task in my task list
And the task should have status "pending"
```

**Implementation Template**:
```typescript
import { Given, When, Then } from '@cucumber/cucumber';
import { expect } from '@playwright/test';
import { CustomWorld } from '../support/world';

// TODO: Implement the step definitions here
```

**Evaluation Criteria**:
- Proper async/await usage (3 points)
- Correct TypeScript typing (3 points)
- Page Object integration (3 points)
- Error handling (3 points)

### **Task 2: Advanced Parameter Handling (20 minutes, 20 points)**

**Scenario**: Implement a custom parameter type and step definition for handling complex user data.

**Requirements**:
1. Create a custom parameter type called `user_profile` that handles user data in the format: "John Doe (admin) with permissions: read,write,delete"
2. Implement a step definition that uses this parameter type
3. Include proper validation and error handling

**Implementation Requirements**:
```typescript
// Custom parameter type implementation
defineParameterType({
  // TODO: Implement custom parameter type

**Scenario**: Implement a step definition with comprehensive error handling for a potentially unreliable operation.

**Requirements**:
Implement a step definition for: "When I upload a file that may fail due to network issues"

The implementation should:
- Handle network timeouts gracefully
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Collect diagnostic information for failures

**Implementation Template**:
```typescript
When('I upload a file that may fail due to network issues', async function () {
  // TODO: Implement with comprehensive error handling
});
```
