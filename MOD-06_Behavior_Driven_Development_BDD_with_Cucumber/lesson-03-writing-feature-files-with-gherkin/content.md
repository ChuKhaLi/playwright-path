# Writing Feature Files with Gherkin

## üìñ Introduction

Gherkin is the language that Cucumber uses to define test cases. It's designed to be non-technical and human readable, allowing business stakeholders, developers, and testers to collaborate effectively. This lesson will teach you to write feature files that serve as both specifications and automated tests.

## üéØ What Makes Good Gherkin?

### The Four Pillars of Effective Feature Files

1. **Business-Focused Language**: Use terms your stakeholders understand
2. **Clear Structure**: Follow consistent patterns and organization
3. **Testable Scenarios**: Write scenarios that can be automated
4. **Living Documentation**: Keep specifications current and valuable

## üìù Gherkin Fundamentals

### Basic Syntax Overview

```gherkin
Feature: User Authentication
  As a registered user
  I want to log into my account
  So that I can access my personal dashboard

  Background:
    Given the application is running
    And the login page is displayed

  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
    Given I am a registered user with email "user@example.com"
    When I enter my valid credentials
    Then I should be logged into my account
    And I should see my personal dashboard

  Scenario: Failed login with invalid password
    Given I am a registered user with email "user@example.com"
    When I enter an incorrect password
    Then I should see an error message "Invalid credentials"
    And I should remain on the login page
```

### Gherkin Keywords Explained

#### **Feature**
- **Purpose**: Describes the feature being tested
- **Structure**: Feature name, narrative (As/I want/So that), scenarios
- **Best Practice**: Keep feature names concise and business-focused

```gherkin
Feature: Shopping Cart Management
  As an online shopper
  I want to manage items in my shopping cart
  So that I can purchase the products I need
```

#### **Scenario**
- **Purpose**: Defines a specific test case
- **Structure**: Scenario name followed by Given-When-Then steps
- **Best Practice**: Use descriptive names that explain the business outcome

```gherkin
Scenario: Adding product to empty cart
Scenario: Removing the last item from cart
Scenario: Applying discount code to cart total
```

#### **Given** - Context/Preconditions
- **Purpose**: Sets up the initial state
- **Examples**: System state, user roles, existing data
- **Best Practice**: Focus on relevant context only

```gherkin
Given I am logged in as a premium user
Given the shopping cart is empty
Given there are 3 products in my cart
Given the system has processed 100 orders today
```

#### **When** - Actions/Events
- **Purpose**: Describes the action being performed
- **Examples**: User interactions, system events, API calls
- **Best Practice**: Use active voice and focus on the trigger

```gherkin
When I click the "Add to Cart" button
When I submit the checkout form
When the payment is processed
When a new order is received
```

#### **Then** - Expected Outcomes
- **Purpose**: Defines expected results and assertions
- **Examples**: UI changes, system responses, data updates
- **Best Practice**: Be specific about expected outcomes

```gherkin
Then I should see "Product added to cart" message
Then the cart total should be "$25.99"
Then I should receive a confirmation email
Then the order status should be "Processing"
```

#### **And/But** - Additional Steps
- **Purpose**: Chain multiple conditions or outcomes
- **Usage**: Improve readability when multiple steps have same context
- **Best Practice**: Use sparingly to maintain clarity

```gherkin
Given I am on the checkout page
And I have items in my cart
And I have selected expedited shipping
When I complete the payment process
Then I should see the order confirmation
And I should receive an order confirmation email
But I should not be charged for standard shipping
```

## üèóÔ∏è Feature File Structure

### Complete Feature File Anatomy

```gherkin
@smoke @user-management
Feature: User Profile Management
  As a registered user
  I want to manage my profile information
  So that I can keep my account details current and accurate

  # This feature covers the core user profile functionality
  # including viewing, editing, and validating profile data

  Background:
    Given the application is running
    And I am logged in as a standard user
    And my profile exists in the system

  @profile-view @happy-path
  Scenario: Viewing complete profile information
    When I navigate to my profile page
    Then I should see my personal information displayed
    And I should see my contact information
    And I should see my account preferences
    And the information should be correctly formatted

  @profile-edit @data-validation
  Scenario: Updating profile with valid information
    Given I am on my profile edit page
    When I update my first name to "John"
    And I update my phone number to "+1-555-123-4567"
    And I save the changes
    Then I should see a success message "Profile updated successfully"
    And my updated information should be displayed
    And the changes should be persisted in the system

  @profile-edit @validation @error-handling
  Scenario: Attempting to save profile with invalid email
    Given I am on my profile edit page
    When I enter an invalid email "not-an-email"
    And I save the changes
    Then I should see an error message "Please enter a valid email address"
    And my profile should not be updated
    And I should remain on the edit page
    And the invalid email field should be highlighted

  @profile-security @password-change
  Scenario: Changing password with proper validation
    Given I am on the profile security page
    When I enter my current password "oldPassword123"
    And I enter a new password "newSecurePass456!"
    And I confirm the new password "newSecurePass456!"
    And I submit the password change form
    Then I should see a success message "Password updated successfully"
    And I should be prompted to log in again
    And my old password should no longer work
```

### Feature File Organization Best Practices

#### **File Naming Conventions**
```
‚úÖ Good Examples:
- user-authentication.feature
- shopping-cart-management.feature
- order-processing-workflow.feature

‚ùå Poor Examples:
- test1.feature
- loginTests.feature
- UserStuff.feature
```

#### **Directory Structure**

## üìä Advanced Gherkin Features

### Scenario Outlines - Data-Driven Testing

```gherkin
Feature: User Input Validation
  
  Scenario Outline: Validating user registration form
    Given I am on the registration page
    When I enter "<email>" in the email field
    And I enter "<password>" in the password field
    And I submit the registration form
    Then I should see "<result>"
    And the form should be "<form_state>"

    Examples: Valid Registration Data
      | email              | password        | result                    | form_state |
      | user@example.com   | SecurePass123!  | Registration successful   | submitted  |
      | test@company.org   | MyPassword456@  | Registration successful   | submitted  |
      
    Examples: Invalid Email Formats
      | email              | password        | result                    | form_state |
      | invalid-email      | SecurePass123!  | Invalid email format      | error      |
      | user@             | SecurePass123!  | Invalid email format      | error      |
      | @example.com       | SecurePass123!  | Invalid email format      | error      |
      
    Examples: Weak Passwords
      | email              | password        | result                    | form_state |
      | user@example.com   | 123            | Password too short        | error      |
      | user@example.com   | password       | Password too weak         | error      |
      | user@example.com   |                | Password required         | error      |
```

### Data Tables for Complex Data

```gherkin
Scenario: Creating a comprehensive user profile
  Given I am on the user registration page
  When I fill out the registration form with the following details:
    | Field         | Value                    |
    | First Name    | John                     |
    | Last Name     | Doe                      |
    | Email         | john.doe@example.com     |
    | Phone         | +1-555-123-4567          |
    | Date of Birth | 1990-05-15               |
    | Address       | 123 Main St              |
    | City          | Anytown                  |
    | State         | CA                       |
    | Zip Code      | 12345                    |
    | Country       | United States            |
  And I agree to the terms and conditions
  And I submit the registration form
  Then I should see a confirmation message
  And I should receive a welcome email
  And my profile should be created with all provided information
```

### Doc Strings for Large Text Content

```gherkin
Scenario: Sending a customer support message
  Given I am logged in as a customer
  And I am on the support contact page
  When I select "Technical Issue" as the category
  And I enter the following message:
    """
    I'm experiencing difficulties with the checkout process. 
    
    Steps I've taken:
    1. Added items to cart successfully
    2. Proceeded to checkout
    3. Entered billing information
    4. Selected payment method
    
    Error encountered:
    When I click "Complete Order", the page freezes and I get a 
    "Payment processing failed" error message. This has happened 
    3 times in the last hour.
    
    Browser: Chrome 120.0
    Operating System: Windows 11
    Order total: $156.99
    """
  And I submit the support request
  Then I should see a confirmation message
  And I should receive a support ticket number
  And the support team should receive my detailed message
```

### Background for Shared Setup

```gherkin
Feature: Online Banking Transactions

  Background:
    Given the banking system is operational
    And I am logged in as an account holder
    And my checking account has a balance of $1,000.00
    And my savings account has a balance of $5,000.00
    And there are no pending transactions

  Scenario: Transferring money between own accounts
    When I transfer $200.00 from checking to savings
    Then my checking account balance should be $800.00
    And my savings account balance should be $5,200.00
    And I should see a transaction confirmation

  Scenario: Making a bill payment
    Given I have set up "Electric Company" as a payee
    When I pay $75.50 to "Electric Company" from my checking account
    Then my checking account balance should be $924.50
    And I should see the payment in my transaction history
    And the payee should receive the payment notification
```

## üé® Writing Effective Scenarios

### The BRIEF Principle

- **B**usiness language
- **R**eal data
- **I**ntention revealing
- **E**ssential steps only
- **F**ocused on one outcome

#### **Business Language Example**

```gherkin
‚úÖ Good - Business Language:
Scenario: Customer requests refund for defective product
  Given I purchased a defective laptop last week
  When I submit a refund request with proof of defect
  Then I should receive a full refund within 5 business days

‚ùå Poor - Technical Language:
Scenario: API call returns 200 status
  Given POST request to /api/refunds endpoint
  When JSON payload contains product_id and reason_code
  Then response status should be 200
```

#### **Real Data vs Abstract Data**

```gherkin
‚úÖ Good - Realistic Data:
Scenario: Calculating shipping cost for international order
  Given I have a cart with total value of $150.00
  And I am shipping to "Toronto, Canada"
  When I select "Express International" shipping
  Then the shipping cost should be $25.00
  And the total order amount should be $175.00

‚ùå Poor - Abstract Data:
Scenario: Calculating shipping cost
  Given I have items in cart
  And I select international shipping
  When I calculate shipping
  Then shipping cost is calculated
```

#### **Intention Revealing Names**

```gherkin
‚úÖ Good - Clear Intention:
Scenario: Premium customer receives priority customer support
Scenario: System prevents duplicate user registration
Scenario: Shopping cart persists across browser sessions

‚ùå Poor - Vague Names:
Scenario: User test case 1
Scenario: Testing the system
Scenario: Check if it works
```

### Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

#### **The "UI Test" Anti-Pattern**

```gherkin
‚ùå Poor - UI Focused:
Scenario: Login functionality
  Given I open the browser
  And I navigate to "https://example.com/login"
  And I see the login form
  When I type "user@example.com" in the email textbox
  And I type "password123" in the password field
  And I click the "Login" button
  Then I should be redirected to "https://example.com/dashboard"

‚úÖ Good - Behavior Focused:
Scenario: User accesses dashboard after successful login
  Given I am a registered user
  When I log in with valid credentials
  Then I should see my personal dashboard
  And I should have access to my account features
```

#### **The "Conjunction" Anti-Pattern**

```gherkin
‚ùå Poor - Multiple Outcomes:
Scenario: User registration and login and profile update
  Given I am on the registration page
  When I create a new account
  And I log in with my new credentials
  And I update my profile information
  Then I should have a complete profile
  And I should be logged in
  And I should see my updated information

‚úÖ Good - Single Focused Outcome:
Scenario: New user completes account setup
  Given I have just registered for an account
  When I complete my profile setup
  Then my account should be fully configured
  And I should be ready to use all features
```

## üîÑ Living Documentation Practices

### Maintaining Feature Currency

#### **Regular Review Process**

```gherkin
# Feature header with maintenance information
Feature: User Account Management
  # Last reviewed: 2024-01-15
  # Stakeholder: Product Owner (jane.smith@company.com)
  # Business value: Critical - User retention depends on account management
  # Update frequency: Monthly or when user requirements change
  
  As a registered user
  I want to manage my account information
  So that I can maintain accurate personal data and preferences
```

#### **Version Control Integration**

```gherkin
# Use meaningful commit messages for feature file changes
# Examples:
# feat: add password reset functionality to user auth
# fix: update validation rules for email format
# docs: clarify shopping cart scenarios based on stakeholder feedback
# test: add edge cases for international shipping calculations
```

### Stakeholder Collaboration Patterns

#### **Three Amigos Sessions**

```gherkin
# Example of collaborative feature writing result
Feature: Return and Refund Processing
  # Created during Three Amigos session on 2024-01-10
  # Participants: Product Owner (Sarah), Developer (Mike), Tester (Lisa)
  # Business rule: Full refunds within 30 days, store credit after 30 days
  
  Rule: Full refunds are available within 30 days
    Scenario: Customer returns item within 30-day window
      Given I purchased a product 15 days ago
      And the product is in original condition
      When I request a return
      Then I should be eligible for a full refund
      And I should receive my refund within 5 business days

  Rule: Store credit is provided for returns after 30 days
    Scenario: Customer returns item after 30-day window
      Given I purchased a product 45 days ago
      And the product is in sellable condition
      When I request a return
      Then I should receive store credit for the purchase amount
      And the store credit should be valid for 1 year
```

### Documentation Generation

#### **Feature File Comments for Context**

```gherkin
Feature: E-commerce Checkout Process
  # Business Context:
  # This feature represents the core revenue-generating flow
  # Any changes must be approved by both Product and Finance teams
  # Performance SLA: Page load < 2 seconds, Transaction completion < 30 seconds
  
  # Technical Context:
  # Integrates with: Payment Gateway API, Inventory Service, Email Service
  # Dependencies: User must be authenticated, Cart must have items
  # Error handling: Graceful degradation with clear user messaging

  Background:
    # Standard checkout prerequisites
    Given I am logged in as a customer
    And I have items in my shopping cart
    And the payment system is operational
    And inventory levels are sufficient for my cart items

  @critical @checkout-flow
  Scenario: Successful purchase with credit card payment
    # This scenario covers the happy path for 80% of our transactions
    Given I am ready to complete my purchase
    When I provide valid payment information
    And I confirm my order
    Then my payment should be processed successfully
    And I should receive an order confirmation
    And my items should be reserved for fulfillment
    And I should receive a confirmation email within 5 minutes
```

## üöÄ Advanced Techniques

### Rule-Based Organization

```gherkin
Feature: Account Security Management

  Rule: Password requirements must be enforced for all users
    
    Scenario: Creating account with secure password
      Given I am registering for a new account
      When I provide a password that meets security requirements
      Then my account should be created successfully
      
    Scenario: Rejecting weak passwords during registration
      Given I am registering for a new account
      When I provide a password that is too weak
      Then I should see password strength requirements
      And my registration should not be completed

  Rule: Account lockout prevents brute force attacks
    
    Scenario: Account locks after multiple failed login attempts
      Given I have attempted to log in 4 times with incorrect password
      When I attempt to log in with incorrect password again
      Then my account should be locked for 30 minutes
      And I should see an account lockout message
```

### Parameterized Backgrounds

```gherkin
Feature: Multi-tier Service Access

  Background:
    Given the application is running in production mode
    And user accounts exist with the following tiers:
      | user_email           | tier      | features_available    |
      | basic@example.com    | Basic     | read_only             |
      | premium@example.com  | Premium   | read_write, export    |
      | admin@example.com    | Admin     | read_write, manage    |

  Scenario: Basic user accesses allowed features
    Given I am logged in as "basic@example.com"
    When I attempt to view my dashboard
    Then I should see my personal data
    But I should not see edit options

  Scenario: Premium user accesses advanced features
    Given I am logged in as "premium@example.com"
    When I attempt to export my data
    Then I should be able to download my information
    And I should see export options in multiple formats
```
