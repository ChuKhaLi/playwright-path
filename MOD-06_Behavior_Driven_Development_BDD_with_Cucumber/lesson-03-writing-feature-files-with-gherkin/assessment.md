## üìù Part A: Gherkin Fundamentals (30 minutes)

### Section A1: Syntax and Structure Knowledge (15 minutes)

#### Question 1: Gherkin Keyword Usage (5 points)
Match each Gherkin keyword with its correct purpose and usage context:

| Keyword | Purpose Options |
|---------|----------------|
| Feature | A) Preconditions that set up the scenario context |
| Background | B) High-level business capability being described |
| Scenario | C) Alternative pathway or additional verification |
| Given | D) Shared setup steps common to all scenarios |
| When | E) Specific business scenario being tested |
| Then | F) Action or event that triggers the behavior |
| And | G) Expected outcome or system response |
| But | H) Additional step in same category as previous step |

**Answer Key**: Feature-B, Background-D, Scenario-E, Given-A, When-F, Then-G, And-H, But-C

#### Question 2: Feature File Structure Analysis (10 points)
Analyze the following feature file and identify **5 structural or syntactic issues**:

```gherkin
feature: User Login System
  I want to log into the system
  So that I can access my account

  given the login page is loaded
  Scenario: successful login
    When I enter valid credentials
    then I should be redirected to dashboard
    and I should see welcome message

  Background:
    Given I am on the login page

  scenario outline: Invalid login attempts
    Given I enter email "<email>" and password "<password>"
    when I click login button
    Then I should see error "<error>"

    examples:
      | email | password | error |
      | invalid@test.com | wrong | Invalid credentials |
```

**Issues to Identify** (2 points each):
1. Feature keyword not capitalized
2. Missing "As a" user story format in feature description  
3. Background placed after scenario (should be before)
4. Inconsistent keyword capitalization (given vs Given, then vs Then)
5. Scenario Outline missing Examples data or incorrect structure

#### Question 3: BRIEF Principle Application (10 points)
Evaluate the following scenario against the BRIEF principle (Business, Real, Intention, Essential, Focused). Identify what's wrong and provide an improved version:

```gherkin
Scenario: User does something with the database
  Given the database connection is established
  And the user table has 1000 records
  And the authentication service is running on port 8080
  And the cache is cleared
  When the user clicks the login button
  And enters "john@example.com" in the email field
  And enters "password123" in the password field  
  And clicks submit
  And waits for 2 seconds for the API response
  Then the HTTP status code should be 200
  And the JWT token should be valid
  And the session should be created in Redis
  And the user should be redirected to /dashboard
  And the page title should contain "Dashboard"
```

**Improvement Areas** (2 points each):
- **Business Language**: Remove technical implementation details
- **Real Examples**: Use realistic business scenarios
- **Clear Intention**: Focus on business outcome
- **Essential Information**: Remove unnecessary technical steps
- **Focused Scope**: One clear business behavior per scenario

---

### Section A2: Business Rule Modeling (15 minutes)

#### Question 4: Business Rule Translation (10 points)
Convert the following business rule into proper Gherkin scenarios:

**Business Rule**: "ReadMore Books applies a 15% discount to orders over $75, but VIP customers get 20% off any order over $50. However, promotional codes cannot be combined with VIP discounts, and the maximum discount on any single order is 30%."

Write **2 scenarios** that capture this rule completely:

**Scenario 1**: _____________________________________
**Scenario 2**: _____________________________________

#### Question 5: Scenario Organization (5 points)
Given these scenario titles, organize them into logical groups and suggest appropriate tags:

- Customer updates profile successfully
- Customer receives welcome email after registration  
- System prevents duplicate email registration
- Customer resets password with valid email
- Invalid email format rejected during registration
- Customer logs out and session expires
- Password reset fails with invalid email
- Profile update fails with invalid phone format

**Organization Groups**:
1. Group 1: _________________ (Tag suggestions: _____________)
2. Group 2: _________________ (Tag suggestions: _____________)  
3. Group 3: _________________ (Tag suggestions: _____________)
