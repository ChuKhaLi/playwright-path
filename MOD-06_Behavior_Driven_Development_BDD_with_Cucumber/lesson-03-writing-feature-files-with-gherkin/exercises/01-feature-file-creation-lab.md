### Task B2: Inventory Management Rules

**Scenario**: ReadMore Books needs to manage inventory levels and handle out-of-stock situations gracefully.

#### Business Rules:
- Books with quantity 0 show as "Out of Stock"
- Books with quantity 1-5 show as "Only X left in stock"
- Books with quantity 6+ show as "In Stock"
- Customers can backorder out-of-stock items
- Pre-orders are available for upcoming releases
- System should prevent overselling

#### Your Task:
Create scenarios that capture inventory business logic in `inventory-management.feature`.

#### Focus on:
- Customer experience with different stock levels
- Business logic for stock display messages
- Handling of edge cases (exactly 0, exactly 1, etc.)
- Backorder and pre-order workflows

---

## üé® Part C: Scenario Organization (20 minutes)

### Task C1: Background Optimization

**Scenario**: Review your feature files from Parts A and B. Identify common setup steps that could be moved to Background sections.

#### Your Task:
Refactor at least two of your feature files to use Background sections effectively.

#### Guidelines:
- Background should contain steps that are truly common to ALL scenarios
- Don't include steps that might change between scenarios
- Keep backgrounds concise and focused
- Ensure backgrounds enhance readability

#### Before/After Example:
```gherkin
# Before: Repetitive setup in each scenario
Scenario: Customer adds book to cart
  Given I am on the ReadMore Books website
  And I am logged in as a customer
  And there are books available in the catalog
  When I add "The Great Gatsby" to my cart
  Then my cart should contain 1 item

Scenario: Customer views empty cart
  Given I am on the ReadMore Books website  
  And I am logged in as a customer
  And there are books available in the catalog
  When I view my shopping cart
  Then I should see "Your cart is empty"

# After: Common setup moved to Background
Background:
  Given I am on the ReadMore Books website
  And I am logged in as a customer
  And there are books available in the catalog

Scenario: Customer adds book to cart
  When I add "The Great Gatsby" to my cart
  Then my cart should contain 1 item

Scenario: Customer views empty cart
  When I view my shopping cart
  Then I should see "Your cart is empty"
```

### Task C2: Tagging Strategy Implementation

**Scenario**: Implement a comprehensive tagging strategy across all your feature files.

#### Required Tag Categories:
1. **Feature Area**: `@shopping-cart`, `@user-management`, `@promotions`, `@inventory`
2. **Test Type**: `@smoke`, `@regression`, `@integration`
3. **Priority**: `@critical`, `@high`, `@medium`, `@low`
4. **Business Impact**: `@revenue-critical`, `@customer-experience`, `@compliance`
5. **Execution**: `@fast`, `@slow`, `@data-dependent`

#### Your Task:
Add appropriate tags to all scenarios in your feature files, considering:
- Which tests should run in smoke test suites
- Which scenarios are critical for revenue
- Which tests might be slow due to complex setup
- Which scenarios test core vs. edge case functionality

#### Example:
```gherkin
@shopping-cart @critical @revenue-critical @smoke
Scenario: Customer completes purchase successfully
  # This scenario is tagged as critical, revenue-impacting, and part of smoke tests

@promotions @medium @customer-experience @data-dependent  
Scenario: Loyalty discount applies correctly for silver members
  # This scenario tests promotions, has medium priority, affects CX, needs test data
```

- [ ] Would a non-technical stakeholder understand them?
- [ ] Are technical implementation details avoided?

#### **R** - Real Examples
- [ ] Do scenarios use realistic data and situations?
- [ ] Are the examples meaningful to actual users?
- [ ] Do they reflect real business workflows?

#### **I** - Intention Focused  
- [ ] Is the business intention clear in each scenario?
- [ ] Do scenarios focus on outcomes rather than processes?
- [ ] Is the value to users/business evident?

#### **E** - Essential Information
- [ ] Are scenarios concise without unnecessary details?
- [ ] Is all information relevant to the behavior being tested?
- [ ] Are there any redundant or overly complex steps?

#### **F** - Focused Scope
- [ ] Does each scenario test one specific behavior?
- [ ] Are scenarios independent and self-contained?
- [ ] Is the scope appropriate for meaningful testing?

---

### Task D2: Peer Review Preparation

Prepare your feature files for peer review by:

1. **Adding Comments**: Include brief comments explaining complex business rules
2. **Checking Formatting**: Ensure consistent indentation and spacing
3. **Validating Syntax**: Review for proper Gherkin keyword usage
4. **Business Alignment**: Confirm scenarios reflect actual business requirements

#### Self-Review Checklist:

## üí° Tips for Success

### Writing Effective Scenarios
1. **Start with the outcome**: Write "Then" steps first to clarify what you're testing
2. **Use concrete examples**: Instead of "some books", use "3 books totaling $45.99"
3. **Focus on behavior**: Describe what the system should do, not how it should do it
4. **Keep scenarios short**: Aim for 3-7 steps per scenario when possible

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Technical language**: Avoid database, API, or UI implementation details
- **Too many scenarios in one file**: Split large features into focused files
- **Weak assertions**: Make "Then" steps specific and verifiable
- **Missing edge cases**: Don't forget error conditions and boundary values
- **Inconsistent language**: Use same terms throughout (e.g., "customer" vs "user")

### Business Collaboration
- **Involve stakeholders**: These scenarios should be reviewable by business experts
- **Use domain language**: Adopt terminology familiar to business users
- **Focus on value**: Each scenario should test something that matters to the business
- **Keep it current**: Feature files should reflect current business rules and processes
