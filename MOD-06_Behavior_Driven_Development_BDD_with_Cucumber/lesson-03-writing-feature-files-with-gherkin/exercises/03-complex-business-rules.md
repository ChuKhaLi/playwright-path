## üß† Part A: Multi-Layered Decision Logic (40 minutes)

### Task A1: Insurance Risk Assessment Engine

**Business Context**: ReadMore Books offers shipping insurance with complex risk assessment algorithms that consider multiple factors to determine coverage eligibility, pricing tiers, and special handling requirements.

#### Business Rules Complexity:

**Primary Risk Factors:**
- Package value tiers: Low (<$50), Medium ($50-$200), High ($200-$500), Premium (>$500)
- Destination risk levels: Safe, Moderate, High-Risk, Restricted
- Shipping method: Standard, Express, Overnight, International
- Customer reliability score: New (0-2), Established (3-6), Trusted (7-8), VIP (9-10)

**Secondary Considerations:**
- Historical claim rate by customer and destination
- Seasonal risk adjustments (holiday rush, weather patterns)
- Package contents (fragile, valuable, restricted items)
- Insurance claim history and fraud indicators

**Decision Matrix Outcomes:**
- Coverage: Approved, Approved with Conditions, Declined
- Premium calculation: Base rate + risk multipliers
- Special requirements: Signature required, Photo proof, Adult signature
- Claim limits: Standard, Enhanced, Premium, Unlimited

#### Your Task:
Create a comprehensive feature file that models this decision matrix using advanced Gherkin patterns.

## üí° Complex Rules Best Practices

### Modeling Techniques

#### **1. Hierarchical Rule Organization**
```gherkin
# Organize rules by priority and dependency
Feature: Primary Business Rules
  # Core rules that other systems depend on

Feature: Secondary Business Rules  
  # Rules that extend or modify primary rules
  
Feature: Exception Handling Rules
  # Special cases and edge condition handling
```

#### **2. Clear Rule Precedence**
```gherkin
Scenario: Rule conflict resolution follows business priority hierarchy
  Given multiple applicable rules:
    | Rule Type          | Priority | Applicability |
    | Customer Tier      | HIGH     | VIP Customer  |
    | Promotional Code   | MEDIUM   | Active Campaign |
    | Volume Discount    | LOW      | Order Size > $100 |
  When rule evaluation is performed
  Then the highest priority rule should take precedence
  And lower priority rules should be adjusted accordingly
```

#### **3. Dependency Mapping**
```gherkin
# Make rule dependencies explicit in scenarios
Given customer eligibility is verified (prerequisite)
And inventory availability is confirmed (prerequisite)
When promotional pricing rules are applied (dependent on prerequisites)
Then pricing calculation should reflect all applicable adjustments
```

### Maintainability Strategies

#### **1. Business Rule Documentation**
- Include business rule references in feature comments
- Link scenarios to business policy documents
- Explain rule precedence and conflict resolution

#### **2. Scenario Organization**
- Group related rule scenarios together
- Use clear naming conventions for complex rules
- Separate normal flow from exception handling

#### **3. Data Management**
- Use realistic business data in examples
- Maintain consistency across related scenarios
- Document data relationships and dependencies
