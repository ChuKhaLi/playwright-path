## üìä Part A: Basic Scenario Outline Creation (35 minutes)

### Task A1: User Login Validation Matrix

**Business Context**: ReadMore Books needs comprehensive login validation that handles various input combinations while providing clear, helpful feedback to users.

#### Business Requirements:
- Email format validation (valid/invalid formats)
- Password strength requirements (minimum 8 characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- Account status checking (active, inactive, locked, pending)
- Graceful error handling with specific user feedback
- Security logging for failed attempts

#### Your Task:
Create a scenario outline that tests all combinations of login validation rules.

#### Template to Start:
```gherkin
@login-validation @security @data-driven
Feature: User Login Validation
  As ReadMore Books platform
  I want to validate user login attempts comprehensively
  So that we maintain security while providing excellent user experience

  Background:
    Given the user authentication service is operational
    And user accounts exist in the system
    And security logging is enabled

  @comprehensive-validation @boundary-testing
  Scenario Outline: Login validation handles various input combinations
    Given a user account with status <accountStatus>
    When login is attempted with:
      | Field    | Value      |
      | email    | <email>    |
      | password | <password> |
    Then the login result should be <loginResult>
    And the user should see message <userMessage>
    And the system should log <logEntry>

    Examples: Valid Login Combinations
      # Add your data here

    Examples: Invalid Email Formats
      # Add your data here

    Examples: Password Validation Failures
      # Add your data here

    Examples: Account Status Issues
      # Add your data here
```

#### Success Criteria:

- [ ] Invalid email formats (minimum 5 examples)
- [ ] Password validation failures (minimum 6 examples)
- [ ] Account status issues (minimum 4 examples)
- [ ] Clear, specific user messages for each scenario
- [ ] Appropriate log entries for security tracking

#### Guidelines:
- Use realistic email examples (both valid and invalid)

4. **Edge Cases**: Empty searches, no results, special characters

#### Template Structure:
```gherkin
@product-search @customer-experience @data-driven
Feature: Product Search and Filtering
  As ReadMore Books customer
  I want to find books efficiently using search and filters
  So that I can quickly discover books that match my interests

  # Create multiple scenario outlines covering different aspects

    | orderValue     | <orderValue>     |
    | bookCount      | <bookCount>      |
    | inventoryStatus| <inventoryStatus>|
  When order processing is initiated
  Then the order should be processed with:
    | Processing Aspect | Expected Value     |
    | shippingOption    | <shippingOption>   |
    | processingTime    | <processingTime>   |
    | loyaltyPoints     | <loyaltyPoints>    |

### Task D1: Data Table Optimization

**Objective**: Review and optimize your scenario outlines from previous tasks for maintainability and readability.

#### Optimization Techniques:

##### **1. Logical Grouping**
```gherkin
# Before: Mixed scenarios in one table
Examples: All Login Scenarios
  | email           | password   | account    | result   | message        |
  | valid@test.com  | Valid123!  | ACTIVE     | SUCCESS  | Welcome back   | 
  | invalid         | Valid123!  | ACTIVE     | FAILED   | Invalid email  |
  | valid@test.com  | weak       | ACTIVE     | FAILED   | Password weak  |
  | valid@test.com  | Valid123!  | LOCKED     | FAILED   | Account locked |

# After: Organized by failure type
Examples: Valid Login Attempts
  | email           | password   | account | result  | message      |
  | valid@test.com  | Valid123!  | ACTIVE  | SUCCESS | Welcome back |

Examples: Email Format Failures  
  | email           | password   | account | result | message       |
  | invalid         | Valid123!  | ACTIVE  | FAILED | Invalid email |
  | @missing.com    | Valid123!  | ACTIVE  | FAILED | Invalid email |

Examples: Password Validation Failures
  | email           | password | account | result | message       |
  | valid@test.com  | weak     | ACTIVE  | FAILED | Password weak |
  | valid@test.com  | 123      | ACTIVE  | FAILED | Password weak |
```

##### **2. Meaningful Parameter Names**
```gherkin
# Before: Generic names
| input1     | input2 | result1 | result2     |
| something  | other  | success | good message|

# After: Business-focused names  
| customerEmail | loginPassword | authResult | userFeedback |
| john@test.com | SecurePass!   | ALLOWED    | Welcome back |
```

#### Your Task:
1. **Review** all your scenario outlines from previous tasks
