Feature: Smart Reading Recommendations Engine
  # BA PERSPECTIVE: Increase conversion rate by 25% through personalized discovery
  # DEV PERSPECTIVE: Machine learning integration with existing customer data platform
  # QA PERSPECTIVE: Recommendation quality metrics and fallback scenarios required

  As a ReadMore Books customer
  I want to receive personalized book recommendations
  So that I can discover books that match my interests and reading preferences

  # BUSINESS RULES (identified during Three Amigos session):
  # - Recommendations based on purchase history, browsing behavior, and ratings
  # - Cold start problem: New users get curated popular recommendations
  # - Privacy controls: Customers can opt out of behavioral tracking
  # - Quality threshold: Only recommend books with 4+ star average rating
  # - Diversity requirement: Recommendations should span multiple genres

  # QUESTIONS TO RESOLVE (from example mapping):
  # - How do we handle customers with very specific niche interests?
  # - Should we recommend out-of-stock books?
  # - How frequently should recommendations refresh?

  Background:
    Given the recommendation engine is operational
    And customer behavioral data is available
    And book catalog with ratings and metadata is current

  @new-customer-experience @cold-start-recommendations
  Scenario: New customer receives curated recommendations
    # BA: Smooth onboarding experience for new customers
    # DEV: Fallback to editorial curation when no behavioral data exists  
    # QA: Edge case for customers with zero interaction history
    
    Given I am a new customer with no purchase history
    And I have not provided explicit preferences
    When I visit the recommendations section
    Then I should see curated recommendations including:
      | Recommendation Type | Count | Criteria                    |
      | Bestsellers         | 5     | Top sellers in last 30 days |
      | Award Winners       | 3     | Recent literary awards      |
      | Staff Picks         | 4     | Editorial team selections   |
      | New Releases        | 3     | Published in last 60 days   |
    And each recommendation should include clear appeal explanation
    And I should be invited to rate books to improve future recommendations

  @personalized-recommendations @behavioral-analysis
  Scenario: Established customer receives personalized recommendations
    # BA: Demonstrate value of data collection through relevant suggestions
    # DEV: Machine learning model processing customer behavioral signals
    # QA: Accuracy validation and recommendation diversity requirements
    
    Given I am an established customer with rich interaction history:
      | Behavioral Signal    | Data Points                           |
      | Purchase History     | 15 fiction books, 8 non-fiction      |
      | Genre Preferences    | Mystery (high), Romance (medium)      |
      | Author Following     | 3 favorite authors identified         |
      | Rating Pattern       | Average 4.2 stars given              |
      | Browsing Behavior    | Spends time reading reviews           |
    When the recommendation engine analyzes my profile
    Then I should receive personalized recommendations that:
      | Quality Metric       | Target                                |
      | Relevance Score      | >85% match to demonstrated preferences|
      | Genre Diversity      | 60% primary interest, 40% exploration |
      | Author Mix           | 30% favorite authors, 70% discovery   |
      | Rating Threshold     | All recommendations >4.0 stars        |
