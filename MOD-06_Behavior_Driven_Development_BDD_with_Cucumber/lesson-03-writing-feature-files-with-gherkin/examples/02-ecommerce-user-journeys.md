```

### Business Context Integration

#### **Revenue Impact Scenarios**
```gherkin
@revenue-critical @conversion-funnel
Scenario: High-value customer completes premium purchase
  # Focus on business metrics and revenue impact
  Given a customer with purchase history over $5,000
  When they add premium items totaling $2,500 to cart
  Then checkout should prioritize:
    | Priority Feature      | Business Reason                    |
    | Express Checkout      | Reduce abandonment for high-value |
    | VIP Support Access    | Ensure smooth premium experience   |
    | Loyalty Point Preview | Show value of completing purchase  |
    | Premium Shipping Free | Incentive for high-value orders   |
```

#### **Customer Lifecycle Scenarios**
```gherkin
@customer-lifecycle @retention @lifetime-value
Scenario: First-time visitor becomes repeat customer
  # Track the complete customer lifecycle progression
  Given an anonymous visitor from search engine
  When they complete their first purchase successfully
  And they receive exceptional post-purchase experience
  Then they should be guided into customer lifecycle:
    | Stage              | Action                               |
    | Welcome Series     | Email series with brand introduction |
    | Product Education  | How-to guides for purchased items    |
    | Community Access   | Invitation to customer community     |
    | Loyalty Program    | Automatic enrollment with benefits   |
    | Repurchase Triggers| Reminders based on product lifecycle |
```

### Complex Data Flow Management

#### **Cross-Session Data Persistence**
```gherkin
@data-persistence @user-experience @seamless-journey
Scenario: Customer journey spans multiple sessions and devices
  Given a customer starts shopping on mobile during lunch break
  And adds items to cart but doesn't complete purchase
  When they continue shopping on desktop at home 2 hours later
  Then their complete context should be preserved:
    | Data Type           | Preservation Method                  |
    | Cart Contents       | Cloud sync across devices            |
    | Browsing History    | Recommendation engine input          |
    | Search Queries      | Personalization data                 |
    | Wishlist Items      | Account-based storage                |
    | Size Preferences    | Profile-based defaults               |
    | Payment Methods     | Encrypted secure storage             |
  And their experience should feel continuous and personalized
```

#### **Multi-Stakeholder Scenarios**
```gherkin
@b2b-purchasing @approval-workflow @complex-stakeholders
Scenario: Business customer manages approval-based purchasing
  Given I am a procurement manager at "TechCorp Inc"
  And my company has a $50,000 monthly purchasing limit
  When I create a purchase order for $15,000 of equipment
  Then the system should handle business purchasing workflow:
    | Workflow Step       | Stakeholder           | Action Required        |
    | Request Creation    | Procurement Manager   | Specify business needs |
    | Budget Approval     | Finance Manager       | Verify budget availability |
    | Technical Review    | IT Manager           | Validate specifications |
    | Final Authorization | Department Director   | Approve purchase       |
    | Purchase Execution  | System               | Process approved order |
  And all stakeholders should receive appropriate notifications
  And the audit trail should be maintained for compliance
```

### Error Handling in User Journeys

#### **Graceful Degradation Patterns**
```gherkin
@error-handling @user-experience @resilience
Scenario: Customer journey continues despite service interruptions
  Given a customer is in the middle of checkout process
  And they have entered all shipping and payment information
  When the payment processing service becomes temporarily unavailable
  Then the system should gracefully handle the situation:
    | Recovery Action        | User Experience                     |
    | Save Progress          | All entered data preserved          |
    | Clear Communication    | "Processing temporarily unavailable"|
    | Alternative Options    | PayPal, saved payment methods       |
    | Status Updates        | Real-time service restoration info   |
    | Retry Mechanism       | One-click retry when service returns|
    | Customer Support      | Immediate chat availability         |
  And the customer should not lose their progress or have to re-enter information
```

#### **Business Rule Validation**
```gherkin
@business-rules @inventory-management @real-time-validation
Scenario: Customer attempts to purchase item with complex availability rules
  Given a limited edition product with complex availability rules:
    | Rule Type              | Condition                           |
    | Geographic Restriction | Available only in certain states   |
    | Purchase Limit         | Maximum 2 per customer              |
    | Time Window           | Available only during flash sale    |
    | Membership Requirement | VIP members get early access        |
  When a non-VIP customer from a restricted state attempts to purchase 3 items
  Then the system should validate each rule in business priority order:
    | Validation Order | Rule Check              | Error Response         |
    | 1               | Geographic Eligibility  | "Not available in your area" |
    | 2               | Membership Status       | "VIP early access period"    |
    | 3               | Quantity Limit         | "Limit 2 per customer"       |
    | 4               | Time Window            | "Sale starts at 3 PM"       |
  And provide clear guidance on how to resolve each restriction
  And maintain the customer's intent to purchase when possible
```

## ðŸ“Š Business Metrics Integration

### Conversion Funnel Tracking

```gherkin
@analytics @conversion-tracking @business-intelligence
Scenario: Customer journey generates comprehensive analytics data
  Given a customer progresses through the complete purchase funnel
  When each major interaction occurs

    | Payment Processing  | Payment method preference, success rate |
    | Order Completion    | Conversion rate, average order value  |
    | Post-Purchase       | Satisfaction score, repeat purchase intent |
  And data should be available for business intelligence analysis
  And privacy regulations should be strictly followed

    | Online to Store     | Product interest shared with staff   |
    | Store to Online     | In-store experience influences recommendations |
    | Support Access      | Full journey context available to agents |
    | Loyalty Program     | Points earned across all channels    |
    | Return Process      | Return to any channel regardless of purchase channel |
