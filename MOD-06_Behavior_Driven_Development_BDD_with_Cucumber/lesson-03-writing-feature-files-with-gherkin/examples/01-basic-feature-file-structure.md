## üìù Complete Feature File Example

### File: `user-authentication.feature`

```gherkin
@authentication @smoke
Feature: User Authentication
  As a registered user
  I want to securely access my account
  So that I can use the application's personalized features

  # This feature covers the core authentication functionality
  # including login, logout, and session management
  # Security requirements: OAuth 2.0 compliant, session timeout after 30 minutes

  Background:
    Given the application server is running
    And the user database contains test accounts
    And the authentication service is available

  @login @happy-path
  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
    Given I am on the login page
    And I am not currently logged in
    When I enter valid email "john.doe@example.com"
    And I enter valid password "SecurePassword123!"
    And I click the login button
    Then I should be redirected to my dashboard
    And I should see a welcome message "Welcome back, John!"
    And my session should be active for 30 minutes

  @login @validation @error-handling
  Scenario: Failed login with incorrect password
    Given I am on the login page
    And a user account exists with email "john.doe@example.com"
    When I enter email "john.doe@example.com"
    And I enter incorrect password "WrongPassword"
    And I click the login button
    Then I should remain on the login page
    And I should see an error message "Invalid email or password"
    And the password field should be cleared
    And my login attempt should be logged for security

  @login @validation @security
  Scenario: Account lockout after multiple failed attempts
    Given I am on the login page
    And a user account exists with email "john.doe@example.com"
    And the account has 4 previous failed login attempts
    When I enter email "john.doe@example.com"
    And I enter incorrect password "WrongPassword"
    And I click the login button
    Then I should see an error message "Account temporarily locked"
    And the account should be locked for 15 minutes
    And an account lockout notification should be sent to the user
    And the lockout event should be logged

  @logout @session-management
  Scenario: User initiated logout
    Given I am logged in as "john.doe@example.com"
    And I am on any page within the application
    When I click the logout button
    Then I should be redirected to the login page
    And my session should be terminated
    And I should see a confirmation message "You have been logged out"
    And any cached user data should be cleared

  @session @timeout @security
  Scenario: Automatic session timeout
    Given I am logged in as "john.doe@example.com"
    And I have been inactive for 30 minutes
    When I attempt to access any protected page
    Then I should be redirected to the login page
    And I should see a message "Your session has expired"
    And my previous session data should be cleared
    And I should be able to log in again

  @login @accessibility
  Scenario: Login page accessibility compliance
    Given I am on the login page
    When I navigate using only keyboard controls
    Then all interactive elements should be accessible via tab navigation
    And form labels should be properly associated with input fields
    And error messages should be announced by screen readers
    And the page should meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
```

## üìä Structure Analysis

  Given I am on the login page
  And I am not currently logged in
  When I enter valid email "john.doe@example.com"
  And I enter valid password "SecurePassword123!"
  And I click the login button
  Then I should be redirected to my dashboard
  And I should see a welcome message "Welcome back, John!"
  And my session should be active for 30 minutes
```

## üé® Gherkin Style Guidelines

### Naming Conventions

#### **Feature Names**
```gherkin
‚úÖ Good Examples:
- User Authentication
- Shopping Cart Management
- Order Processing Workflow
- Customer Support Ticketing

‚ùå Poor Examples:
- Login Tests
- Test Suite 1
- UI Validation
- System Check
```

#### **Scenario Names**
```gherkin
‚úÖ Good Examples:
- Successful login with valid credentials
- Account lockout after multiple failed attempts
- Password reset via email verification
- Session timeout redirects to login

‚ùå Poor Examples:
- Test case 1
- Login test
- Check validation
- Verify functionality
```

### Step Writing Patterns

#### **Given Step Patterns**
```gherkin
# User State
Given I am logged in as "user@example.com"
Given I am not currently authenticated
Given I have an active session

# System State  
Given the authentication service is available
Given the user database contains test accounts
Given rate limiting is enabled

# Data State
Given a user account exists with email "test@example.com"
Given the account has 3 failed login attempts
Given the user has premium account privileges
```

#### **When Step Patterns**
```gherkin
# User Actions
When I enter email "user@example.com"
When I click the login button
When I navigate to the dashboard

# System Events
When the session expires
When the authentication service becomes unavailable
When a password reset is requested

# Time-based Events
When 30 minutes have passed
When the daily limit is reached
When the maintenance window begins
```

#### **Then Step Patterns**
```gherkin
# UI Validation
Then I should see the dashboard page
Then the error message "Invalid credentials" should be displayed
Then the login form should be cleared

# State Validation
Then my session should be active
Then the account should be locked
Then the user should be logged out

# System Behavior
Then a notification email should be sent
Then the login attempt should be logged
Then the session data should be cleared
```

## üöÄ Advanced Patterns

### Conditional Logic with Rules

```gherkin
Feature: Account Security

  Rule: Passwords must meet complexity requirements
    
    Scenario: Strong password accepted
      Given I am creating a new account
      When I provide password "MySecure123!@#"
      Then the password should be accepted
      
    Scenario: Weak password rejected
      Given I am creating a new account  
      When I provide password "123456"
      Then I should see "Password does not meet requirements"

  Rule: Account lockout prevents brute force attacks
    
    Scenario: Account locks after 5 failed attempts
      Given I have failed to log in 4 times
      When I fail to log in again
      Then my account should be locked for 15 minutes
```

### Multiple Example Categories

```gherkin
@login @data-driven
Scenario Outline: Login validation with various inputs
  Given I am on the login page
  When I enter email "<email>" and password "<password>"
  And I submit the login form
  Then I should see "<result>"

  Examples: Valid Credentials
    | email              | password        | result           |
    | user@example.com   | ValidPass123!   | Welcome message  |
    | admin@company.org  | AdminSecure456@ | Admin dashboard  |

  Examples: Invalid Credentials  
    | email              | password        | result           |
    | invalid@email      | ValidPass123!   | Invalid email    |
    | user@example.com   | wrongpassword   | Invalid password |
    | user@example.com   | 123            | Password too weak |
```

## üìö Summary

This example demonstrates:

1. **Complete Feature Structure** - All essential Gherkin elements
2. **Proper Syntax Usage** - Correct keyword application
3. **Business Focus** - Stakeholder-friendly language
4. **Quality Organization** - Logical scenario grouping
5. **Best Practices** - Industry-standard patterns

### Key Takeaways

- **Structure Matters**: Consistent organization improves readability
- **Business Language**: Focus on outcomes, not implementation
- **Tag Strategy**: Use hierarchical, meaningful categorization

### Next Steps

With this foundation, you can:
- Create your own feature files using these patterns
- Adapt the structure to your domain and requirements
- Build scenario libraries for common business processes
- Establish team standards based on these examples

Remember: Great feature files are living documents that evolve with your understanding of the business domain! üéØ
