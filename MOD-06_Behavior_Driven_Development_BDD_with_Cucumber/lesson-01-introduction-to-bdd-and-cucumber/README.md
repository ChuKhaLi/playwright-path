# Lesson 01: Introduction to BDD and Cucumber

## Overview

Welcome to the first lesson of **MOD-06: Behavior Driven Development (BDD) with Cucumber**! This foundational lesson introduces you to the philosophy and methodology of Behavior Driven Development (BDD) and how it revolutionizes collaboration between technical and non-technical stakeholders in software testing.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- **Define Behavior Driven Development** and explain its benefits for QA automation
- **Identify the Three Amigos approach** and collaborative testing practices  
- **Compare BDD with traditional testing methodologies** (TDD, manual testing)
- **Recognize the structure and purpose** of Gherkin language
- **Evaluate real-world scenarios** where BDD provides value

## Lesson Structure

| Component | Description | Estimated Time |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Content** | Core concepts and methodology | 90 minutes |
| **Examples** | Real-world BDD scenarios | 45 minutes |
| **Exercises** | Hands-on BDD scenario creation | 60 minutes |
| **Assessment** | Knowledge check and reflection | 30 minutes |

**Total Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours

## Prerequisites

Before starting this lesson, ensure you have completed:

- [**MOD-01: TypeScript Fundamentals**](../../../MOD-01_TypeScript_Fundamentals/README.md) - Understanding of basic programming concepts
- [**MOD-02: Testing Fundamentals**](../../../MOD-02_Testing_Fundamentals/README.md) - Knowledge of testing principles and methodologies  
- [**MOD-E2E-01: Playwright Basics**](../../../MOD-E2E-01_Playwright_Basics/README.md) - Familiarity with automated testing
- [**MOD-03: Advanced Playwright**](../../../MOD-03_Advanced_Playwright/README.md) - Experience with complex test scenarios
- [**MOD-04: Page Object Model**](../../../MOD-04_Page_Object_Model/README.md) - Understanding of test architecture patterns

## Key Concepts Covered

### ü§ù Collaborative Development
- **Three Amigos:** Product Owner, Developer, Tester collaboration
- **Shared Understanding:** Bridging communication gaps
- **Living Documentation:** Executable specifications as documentation

### üîÑ BDD Methodology  
- **Outside-In Development:** Starting with user behavior
- **Given-When-Then:** Structured scenario format
- **Ubiquitous Language:** Common vocabulary for all stakeholders

### ü•í Cucumber Framework
- **Gherkin Language:** Business-readable domain-specific language
- **Step Definitions:** Connecting scenarios to executable code  
- **Feature Files:** Organizing behavioral specifications

### üéØ Business Value
- **Requirements Clarity:** Reducing misunderstandings
- **Test Automation:** Converting specifications to tests
- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Including non-technical team members

## What You'll Build

In this lesson, you'll work with scenarios for an **e-commerce website** that will be used throughout the module:

- **User Registration:** Creating new customer accounts
- **Product Search:** Finding products in the catalog
- **Shopping Cart:** Adding and managing items
- **Checkout Process:** Completing purchases

These scenarios will demonstrate how BDD bridges business requirements and technical implementation.

## Lesson Components

### üìö [Content](content.md)
Comprehensive coverage of BDD concepts, methodology, and collaborative practices with real-world examples and comparisons to traditional testing approaches.

### üíª [Examples](examples/)
- Basic Gherkin scenarios for e-commerce features
- Comparison between traditional test cases and BDD scenarios  
- Collaborative documentation examples
- Benefits demonstration through before/after scenarios

### üèãÔ∏è [Exercises](exercises/)
- **Exercise 1:** Identify BDD opportunities in existing projects
- **Exercise 2:** Transform traditional test cases to Gherkin scenarios
- **Exercise 3:** Design collaborative BDD process for team scenarios
- **Exercise 4:** Create feature files for common business workflows

### üìù [Assessment](assessment.md)
- **Knowledge Check:** 6 multiple choice questions (75% passing)
- **Reflection Questions:** BDD methodology and collaborative benefits
- **Practical Evaluation:** Gherkin scenario creation and analysis

## Next Steps

After completing this lesson:

1. **Review** the core BDD concepts and collaborative benefits
2. **Practice** writing basic Gherkin scenarios for familiar applications  
3. **Prepare** for [**Lesson 02: Setting Up Cucumber with TypeScript and Playwright**](../lesson-02-setting-up-cucumber-with-typescript-and-playwright/README.md)
4. **Consider** how BDD could improve communication in your current projects
