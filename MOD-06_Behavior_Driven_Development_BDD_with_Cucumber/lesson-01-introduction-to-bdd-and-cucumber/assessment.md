```

**New Scenario Writing (10 points):**
```gherkin
Feature: Shopping Cart Management

  As a customer browsing products
  I want to add items to my cart and see the updated total
  So that I can track my potential purchase before checkout

Scenario: Adding product to cart updates total price
  Given I am viewing a product priced at $29.99
  And my cart is currently empty
  When I add the product to my cart
  Then my cart should contain 1 item
