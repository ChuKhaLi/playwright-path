# Lesson 01 Examples: Introduction to BDD and Cucumber

This directory contains practical examples demonstrating BDD concepts and Gherkin scenario writing. These examples will help you understand how BDD bridges business requirements and technical implementation.

## Example Files

### üéØ [Basic BDD Concepts](01-basic-bdd-concepts.md)
Demonstrates the fundamental principles of BDD with simple, clear examples showing the difference between traditional and BDD approaches.

### üõí [E-commerce Feature Files](02-ecommerce-feature-files.md) 
Complete Gherkin feature files for common e-commerce scenarios that will be used throughout the module.

### üìä [Traditional vs BDD Comparison](03-traditional-vs-bdd-comparison.md)
Side-by-side comparison showing how traditional test cases transform into BDD scenarios.

### ü§ù [Collaborative Scenarios](04-collaborative-scenarios.md)
Examples of how the Three Amigos approach creates better scenarios through collaboration.

## How to Use These Examples

1. **Read through each example** to understand the concepts being demonstrated
2. **Compare traditional and BDD approaches** to see the benefits of collaborative testing
3. **Study the Gherkin syntax** and structure used in the feature files
4. **Consider how these patterns** apply to your own projects and testing scenarios

These examples build foundational understanding that will be expanded in subsequent lessons with actual implementation and automation.
