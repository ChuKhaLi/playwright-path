# Exercise 03: Three Amigos Collaboration Simulation

**Difficulty:** Intermediate  
**Estimated Time:** 25 minutes  
**Skills Practiced:** Collaborative scenario creation, stakeholder perspectives, edge case identification, business-technical alignment

## Learning Objectives

By completing this exercise, you will:
- Experience the Three Amigos collaborative approach to scenario creation
- Practice thinking from different stakeholder perspectives (Product Owner, Developer, Tester)
- Learn to identify and incorporate technical constraints and quality risks

## Exercise Overview

You'll role-play as each member of the Three Amigos team to iteratively improve BDD scenarios. Starting with a basic user story, you'll enhance it by considering each stakeholder's perspective and concerns.

## The Three Amigos Roles

### üè¢ Product Owner (PO)
**Focus:** Business value, user needs, acceptance criteria
**Concerns:** User experience, business rules, market requirements
**Questions:** What value does this provide? How do users benefit? What are the business rules?

### üë©‚Äçüíª Developer (DEV)  
**Focus:** Technical feasibility, implementation details, system constraints
**Concerns:** Architecture, performance, dependencies, edge cases
**Questions:** How will this work technically? What could go wrong? What are the constraints?

### üß™ Tester (QA)
**Focus:** Quality assurance, risk assessment, comprehensive coverage
**Concerns:** Edge cases, error scenarios, user experience, security
**Questions:** What could fail? What are the risks? How do we verify quality?

```

#### Final Collaborative Scenarios:
```gherkin
Feature: Order Status Email Notifications
  As a customer who has placed an order
  I want to receive timely and accurate email notifications about my order status
  So that I can stay informed about my purchase without having to check the website

  Background:
    Given I am a registered customer with email "customer@example.com"
    And I have placed order "ORD-123456" containing:
      | product    | quantity | price |
      | iPhone 14  | 1        | $999  |
      | Phone Case | 1        | $25   |

  Scenario: Receive order confirmation email immediately after purchase
    When my order is successfully placed
    Then I should receive order confirmation email within 2 minutes
    And the email should contain:
      | field          | value                    |
      | order_number   | ORD-123456              |
      | total_amount   | $1,024.00               |
      | items_count    | 2                       |
      | delivery_date  | [estimated date]        |
    And the email should include order tracking link

  Scenario: Receive shipping notification with tracking information
    Given my order status changes to "shipped"
    When the shipping notification is triggered
    Then I should receive shipping confirmation email within 30 minutes
    And the email should contain tracking number
    And the email should include carrier information
    And tracking link should be valid and functional

  Scenario: Handle email delivery failure with retry
    Given my email provider is temporarily unavailable
    When order confirmation email is sent
    Then the system should retry delivery 3 times over 24 hours
    And if delivery still fails, customer support should be notified
    And I should see order confirmation in my account dashboard

  Scenario: Respect customer email preferences
    Given I have unsubscribed from promotional emails
    But I have opted to receive order notifications
    When my order status changes
    Then I should still receive order-related emails
    And I should not receive promotional content in order emails
    And email should include preference management link
```

- Identify **quality risks** and edge cases (QA input)
- Collaboratively create **comprehensive scenarios**

### 3. Outcome Documentation
- Record all scenarios in Gherkin format
- Capture assumptions and decisions made
- Note any follow-up research or investigation needed
- Ensure all participants agree on final scenarios

### 4. Success Indicators
- All stakeholders understand and agree on scenarios
- Technical implementation is feasible
- Quality risks are identified and addressed
- Scenarios are comprehensive and testable

## Common Collaboration Challenges

### Challenge 1: Dominant Perspectives
**Problem:** One role dominates discussion, others don't contribute
**Solution:** Use structured turn-taking, ensure each role has dedicated time

### Challenge 2: Getting Lost in Details  
**Problem:** Sessions become too technical or too business-focused
**Solution:** Keep focus on user behavior and value, park detailed discussions

### Challenge 3: Disagreement on Requirements
**Problem:** Stakeholders have conflicting views on what's needed
**Solution:** Use scenarios to explore different options, escalate unresolved conflicts

### Challenge 4: Time Management
**Problem:** Sessions run too long or don't cover all scenarios
**Solution:** Timebox discussions, focus on most critical scenarios first

## Next Steps

After completing this collaborative exercise:

1. **Reflect on the process** - which role perspectives were most valuable?
2. **Compare scenario quality** - how much better are collaborative scenarios?
3. **Move to Exercise 04** to analyze BDD vs traditional approaches
4. **Practice facilitation** - try leading Three Amigos sessions in real projects

Remember: The Three Amigos approach is about shared understanding, not just better documentation. The conversations and collaboration are as valuable as the scenarios produced.
