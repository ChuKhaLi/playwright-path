- Stakeholder perspective taking
- Collaborative scenario enhancement
- Edge case identification
- Business-technical alignment

### [Exercise 04: BDD vs Traditional Testing Analysis](./04-bdd-vs-traditional-analysis.md)
Analyze testing scenarios and identify improvements that BDD approach would provide.

- Critical analysis
- Approach comparison
- Benefit identification
- Quality assessment

## Tips for Success

### üéØ **Focus on User Value**
- Always start with "why" - what value does this provide to users?
- Write scenarios from the user's perspective, not system functionality
- Include business context in your scenarios

### üìù **Keep Language Simple**
- Use plain English that all stakeholders can understand
- Avoid technical jargon in scenario descriptions
- Make scenarios readable by business users

### ü§ù **Think Collaboratively**
- Consider different stakeholder perspectives
- Include both happy path and edge cases
- Think about what could go wrong

### üîç **Be Specific**
- Use concrete examples instead of abstract descriptions
- Include specific data values where relevant
- Make expected outcomes clear and measurable
