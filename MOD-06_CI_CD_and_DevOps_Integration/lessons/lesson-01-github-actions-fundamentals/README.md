**Difficulty**: Beginner  
**Prerequisites**: Basic Git knowledge, GitHub account

This lesson introduces GitHub Actions as the primary CI/CD platform for automated testing. You'll learn the fundamental concepts, create your first workflows, and establish the foundation for more advanced CI/CD patterns.

## üèóÔ∏è Lesson Structure

### **Part 1: GitHub Actions Architecture (45 minutes)**
- Understanding workflows, jobs, and steps
- Runners and execution environments
- Actions marketplace and reusable components
- YAML syntax and workflow configuration

### **Part 2: Creating Your First Workflow (60 minutes)**
- Setting up a basic Playwright testing workflow
- Configuring Node.js environment
- Installing dependencies and running tests
- Handling test results and artifacts

### **Part 3: Workflow Triggers and Events (45 minutes)**
- Push and pull request triggers
- Scheduled workflows with cron syntax
- Manual workflow dispatch
- Conditional execution and filtering

### **Part 4: Secrets and Environment Management (30 minutes)**
- Creating and managing repository secrets
- Environment variables and contexts
- Security best practices
- Environment-specific configurations

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Concepts Covered

### **GitHub Actions Components**
- **Workflows**: Automated processes defined in YAML files
- **Jobs**: Groups of steps that execute on the same runner
- **Steps**: Individual tasks within a job
- **Actions**: Reusable units of code for common tasks
- **Runners**: Virtual machines that execute workflows

### **Workflow Configuration**
- **Triggers**: Events that start workflow execution
- **Environment Setup**: Node.js, dependencies, and tools
- **Test Execution**: Running Playwright tests in CI
- **Artifact Management**: Storing test results and reports

### **Security and Best Practices**
- **Secret Management**: Secure handling of sensitive data
- **Permissions**: Controlling workflow access and capabilities
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient use of runner resources
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure management

## üìã Hands-on Exercises

### **Exercise 1: Basic Workflow Creation**
Create a simple GitHub Actions workflow that:
- Triggers on push to main branch
- Sets up Node.js environment
- Installs Playwright dependencies
- Runs a basic test suite

### **Exercise 2: Multi-Environment Testing**
Extend the workflow to:
- Test against multiple Node.js versions
- Use matrix strategy for parallel execution
- Handle different browser configurations
- Store test results as artifacts

### **Exercise 3: Secret Management**
Implement secure configuration:
- Add repository secrets for API keys
- Configure environment-specific variables
- Use secrets in test execution
- Implement proper security practices

## üéØ Practical Applications

### **Real-World Scenarios**
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing on every code change
- **Pull Request Validation**: Ensuring code quality before merge
- **Scheduled Testing**: Regular health checks and regression testing
- **Multi-Environment Deployment**: Testing across different environments

### **Industry Best Practices**
- **Fail Fast**: Quick feedback on test failures
- **Parallel Execution**: Optimizing test execution time
- **Artifact Storage**: Preserving test results and reports
- **Notification Integration**: Team communication on test results
