## Part A: Theoretical Knowledge (30 points)

### Question 1: Headless Configuration Fundamentals (10 points)

**1.1** (3 points) Explain the key differences between headless and headed browser execution in Playwright. List three scenarios where headless mode is preferred and three where headed mode might be necessary.

**1.2** (4 points) Describe the relationship between browser launch options and headless performance. Provide specific examples of launch options that significantly impact headless test execution speed and resource usage.

### Question 2: Performance Optimization Strategies (10 points)

**2.1** (4 points) Analyze the following headless configuration and identify three potential performance improvements. Explain your reasoning for each improvement:

```typescript
const browser = await chromium.launch({
  headless: true,
  args: [
    '--no-sandbox',
    '--disable-setuid-sandbox',
    '--disable-dev-shm-usage',
    '--disable-accelerated-2d-canvas',
    '--disable-gpu',
    '--window-size=1920,1080'

  viewport: { width: 1920, height: 1080 },
  deviceScaleFactor: 2,
  hasTouch: true,
  isMobile: false,
  javaScriptEnabled: true,
