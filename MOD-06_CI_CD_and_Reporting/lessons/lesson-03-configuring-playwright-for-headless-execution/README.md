# Lesson 03: Configuring Playwright for Headless Execution

## Overview

This lesson focuses on configuring Playwright for optimal headless execution in CI/CD environments. You'll learn how to optimize browser settings, handle environment-specific configurations, and implement best practices for reliable headless testing that performs well in automated pipelines.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- **Configure headless browser settings** for optimal CI/CD performance
- **Implement environment detection** and automatic headless mode switching
- **Optimize browser launch options** for different testing scenarios
- **Handle headless-specific challenges** like viewport management and resource loading
- **Debug headless test failures** effectively using logging and artifacts
