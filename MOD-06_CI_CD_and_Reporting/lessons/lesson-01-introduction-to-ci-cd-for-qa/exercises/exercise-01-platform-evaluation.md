## üìã Exercise Overview

You'll work through a realistic platform selection scenario, evaluating different CI/CD options for a fictional company and presenting your recommendation with supporting analysis.

### **Scenario: TechCorp E-commerce Platform**

**Company Profile:**
- **Team Size**: 25 developers, 5 QA engineers
- **Current Stack**: JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Node.js, PostgreSQL
- **Repository**: GitHub (migrated 6 months ago)
- **Testing**: Manual testing + some Playwright E2E tests
- **Release Frequency**: Monthly releases (want to move to weekly)
- **Budget**: $2,000-5,000/month for CI/CD tooling
- **Compliance**: PCI DSS for payment processing

**Current Pain Points:**
- Manual testing takes 3-5 days per release
- 15-20 critical bugs reach production monthly
- Deployment process takes 4-6 hours
- No automated quality gates
- Testing environment inconsistencies

## üèóÔ∏è Part 2: Platform Evaluation (20 minutes)

### **Task 2.1: Platform Scoring**

Using the comparison matrix from the examples, score each platform for TechCorp's specific needs:

| Criteria | Weight | GitHub Actions | Jenkins | Azure DevOps | CircleCI |
|----------|--------|----------------|---------|--------------|----------|
| **GitHub Integration** | 25% | ___/5 | ___/5 | ___/5 | ___/5 |
| **Ease of Setup** | 20% | ___/5 | ___/5 | ___/5 | ___/5 |
| **Cost Effectiveness** | 20% | ___/5 | ___/5 | ___/5 | ___/5 |
| **PCI Compliance** | 15% | ___/5 | ___/5 | ___/5 | ___/5 |
| **Scalability** | 10% | ___/5 | ___/5 | ___/5 | ___/5 |
| **Team Adoption** | 10% | ___/5 | ___/5 | ___/5 | ___/5 |

### **Task 2.2: Cost Projection**

Calculate monthly costs for each platform based on TechCorp's usage:

**Usage Assumptions:**
- 40 commits per day (growing team)
- 30 minutes average test execution
- 22 working days per month
- Matrix testing: 3 browsers √ó 2 OS = 6 combinations

```yaml
# GitHub Actions Cost Calculation
monthly-usage:
  commits-per-month: 40 √ó 22 = 880
  minutes-per-test-run: 30 √ó 6 = 180
  total-monthly-minutes: 880 √ó 180 = 158,400
  free-tier-minutes: 2,000
  billable-minutes: 156,400
  cost-per-minute: $0.008
  monthly-cost: $____

# Jenkins Cost (Self-hosted)
infrastructure-cost: $300/month (servers)
maintenance-cost: $1,500/month (0.5 FTE DevOps)
compliance-setup: $2,000 (one-time)
total-monthly-equivalent: $____

# Azure DevOps Cost
user-licenses: 30 √ó $6 = $180
parallel-jobs: 10 √ó $40 = $400
compliance-features: $200
total-monthly: $____

# CircleCI Cost
performance-plan: 30 √ó $15 = $450
credit-usage: $600 (estimated)
total-monthly: $____
```

### **Task 2.3: Weighted Scoring**

Calculate final weighted scores:

```yaml
# Weighted Score Calculation
scoring-formula: (score √ó weight) summed across all criteria

github-actions: ____/5.0
jenkins: ____/5.0
azure-devops: ____/5.0
circleci: ____/5.0
```

**üí° Scoring Hints:**
- GitHub Actions: Excellent GitHub integration, easy setup
- Jenkins: Maximum flexibility, high maintenance
- Azure DevOps: Good compliance, higher cost
- CircleCI: Great performance, steeper learning curve

## üí∞ Part 3: ROI Analysis (10 minutes)

### **Task 3.1: Projected Benefits**

Calculate the potential improvements for your recommended platform:

```yaml
# Projected Improvements (Annual)
time-savings:
  testing-automation: ___% reduction √ó $____ = $____
  deployment-automation: ___% reduction √ó $____ = $____
  
quality-improvement:
  reduced-production-bugs: ___% √ó $____ = $____
  faster-issue-resolution: ___% √ó $____ = $____
  
productivity-gains:
  faster-release-cycles: ____ additional releases √ó $____ = $____
  developer-efficiency: ___% improvement √ó $____ = $____
  
total-annual-benefits: $____
```

### **Task 3.2: Implementation Costs**

```yaml
# Implementation Investment
platform-costs: $____ (annual)
setup-time: ____ hours √ó $50/hour = $____
training-costs: $____ 
process-changes: $____
contingency: $____ (10% of total)

total-implementation-cost: $____
```

### **Task 3.3: ROI Calculation**

```yaml
# ROI Analysis
net-annual-benefit: benefits - annual-costs = $____
roi-percentage: (net-benefit √∑ investment) √ó 100 = ____%
payback-period: investment √∑ monthly-savings = ____ months

# Risk-adjusted ROI (conservative estimate)
conservative-benefits: benefits √ó 0.7 = $____
conservative-roi: ____%
```

**üí° Expected Results:**
- ROI should be 200-500% for well-implemented CI/CD
- Payback period typically 6-12 months
- Conservative estimates help with stakeholder buy-in
