```
Problem 1: [Late defect detection]
Why problematic: [Cost multiplier, delayed feedback, etc.]

Problem 2: [Manual testing bottleneck]  
Why problematic: [Human error, inconsistency, etc.]

Problem 3: [Quarterly release cycle]
Why problematic: [Large batch size, higher risk, etc.]
```

**Question B1.2 (5 points)**: Describe how implementing CI/CD with shift-left testing would address each of the problems you identified.

**Sample Answer Framework**:
```
Solution for Problem 1: [Continuous testing, early feedback]
How it helps: [Specific benefits and mechanisms]

How it helps: [Specific improvements and outcomes]

Solution for Problem 3: [Frequent small releases]
How it helps: [Risk reduction, faster value delivery]
```

**Question B1.3 (5 points)**: Calculate the potential time savings if MegaCorp moved from quarterly manual testing (3 weeks each) to daily automated testing (30 minutes each). Show your calculations and explain the business impact.

**Sample Calculation**:
```
Current approach: 3 weeks √ó 4 quarters = 12 weeks/year
Proposed approach: 30 minutes √ó 365 days = _____ weeks/year
