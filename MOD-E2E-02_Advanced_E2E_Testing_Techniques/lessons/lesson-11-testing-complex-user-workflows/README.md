# Lesson 11: Testing Complex User Workflows

## Lesson Overview

This lesson focuses on strategies for testing end-to-end user workflows that span multiple pages, involve conditional logic, and require data to be passed between steps. You will learn how to structure these complex tests to be readable, maintainable, and robust, using techniques like creating custom helper functions and modeling multi-step processes.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Break down a complex user workflow into logical, testable steps.
-   Structure long tests to be readable and easy to debug.
-   Use helper functions to encapsulate repeated actions or setup steps.
-   Pass data and state between different steps of a workflow.
-   Write tests that cover conditional paths and decision points in a user journey.
