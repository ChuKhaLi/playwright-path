# Lesson 3: Testing Single-Page Applications (SPA)

## Lesson Overview

This lesson covers the unique challenges and strategies involved in testing Single-Page Applications (SPAs) built with frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue. You will learn how to write stable and effective tests that handle client-side routing, asynchronous data loading, and dynamic content rendering.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Understand the key characteristics of SPAs and their impact on testing.
-   Implement tests that correctly handle client-side navigation without full page reloads.
-   Use web-first assertions and auto-waiting to handle asynchronous operations gracefully.
-   Mock API requests to isolate the frontend and create predictable test states.
-   Write tests for dynamically rendered components and data.
