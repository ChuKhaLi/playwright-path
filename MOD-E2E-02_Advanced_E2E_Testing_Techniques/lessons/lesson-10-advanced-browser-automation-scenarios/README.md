# Lesson 10: Advanced Browser Automation Scenarios

## Lesson Overview

This lesson moves beyond typical page interactions to cover advanced browser automation scenarios. You will learn how to work with multiple browser tabs, handle browser dialogs (alerts, prompts, confirms), and test features that interact with the clipboard, extending your automation capabilities to cover more complex user workflows.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Automate workflows that involve multiple browser tabs or windows.
-   Handle native browser dialogs like `alert`, `prompt`, and `confirm`.
-   Test "copy to clipboard" functionality by reading from and writing to the system clipboard.
-   Interact with pages that have custom browser contexts, such as different permissions or locales.
-   Understand how to manage focus between different pages and contexts.
