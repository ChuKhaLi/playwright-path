# Lesson 7: Advanced Network Interception and Mocking

## Lesson Overview

Building on the basics of API mocking, this lesson explores advanced network interception techniques in Playwright. You will learn how to modify network requests and responses on the fly, test various failure scenarios like network errors and slow responses, and manage complex mocking scenarios for robust testing of your application's network resilience.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Use `page.route()` to intercept and modify API requests before they are sent.
-   Modify API responses to test how the UI handles different data or status codes.
-   Simulate network failures and server errors to test application resilience.
-   Abort requests for specific resources (e.g., tracking scripts, images) to speed up tests.
-   Organize and manage complex mocking logic for different test scenarios.
