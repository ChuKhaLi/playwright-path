# Lesson 1: Advanced Element Interaction Patterns

## Lesson Overview

This lesson explores advanced techniques for interacting with web elements using Playwright. Building on basic interactions, you will learn how to handle complex scenarios such as hover, drag-and-drop, and interactions with dynamic or custom UI components.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Implement hover and focus actions to reveal hidden elements.
-   Perform drag-and-drop operations on UI elements.
-   Interact with sliders, custom dropdowns, and other complex form controls.
-   Handle elements that appear dynamically or require specific user actions to become interactive.
-   Use Playwright's advanced actionability checks to ensure elements are ready for interaction.
