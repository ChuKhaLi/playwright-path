# Lesson 6: Testing Real-time Applications (WebSockets)

## Lesson Overview

This lesson introduces strategies for testing applications that use WebSockets for real-time, bidirectional communication. You will learn how to listen for WebSocket events, assert on messages sent and received, and test the dynamic UI updates that result from real-time data.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Understand the basics of the WebSocket protocol and its use cases.
-   Use Playwright to listen for WebSocket connections and frames (messages).
-   Write tests that assert on the content of WebSocket messages.
-   Test UI components that update in real-time based on WebSocket events.
-   Differentiate between testing the WebSocket communication itself and the resulting UI changes.
