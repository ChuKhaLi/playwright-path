# Lesson 01: Authentication and Session Management

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Implement multi-step authentication flows with Playwright
- Handle various authentication methods (form-based, OAuth, social login)
- Manage session state and cookies across test scenarios
- Implement authentication state reuse for test optimization
- Handle password reset and recovery workflows

## üìö Lesson Overview

**Duration**: 4-6 hours  
**Type**: E2E Advanced  
**Prerequisites**: MOD-03 Lesson 03 (Basic Authentication)

This lesson covers advanced authentication patterns essential for testing modern web applications. You'll learn to handle complex login flows, manage session persistence, and optimize test execution through authentication state reuse.

## üîë Key Topics

### **Multi-Step Authentication**
- Two-factor authentication (2FA) handling
- Multi-page login flows
- Conditional authentication logic
- CAPTCHA and security challenge handling

### **Authentication Methods**
- Form-based authentication with validation
- OAuth 2.0 and social media login
- Single Sign-On (SSO) integration
- API key and token-based authentication

### **Session Management**
- Cookie handling and persistence
- Local storage and session storage
- Authentication state reuse across tests
- Session timeout and renewal

### **Advanced Scenarios**
- Password reset and recovery workflows
- Account lockout and security policies
- Role-based access control testing
- Cross-domain authentication

## üõ†Ô∏è Hands-On Exercises

### **Exercise 1**: Multi-Step Login Automation
Implement automated testing for a complex login flow with email verification and 2FA.

### **Exercise 2**: OAuth Integration Testing
Test social media login integration with proper token handling and user data validation.

### **Exercise 3**: Session State Management
Create a framework for authentication state reuse to optimize test execution time.

## üìä Assessment

- **Practical Implementation**: Multi-step authentication test suite
- **Code Review**: Authentication helper utilities
- **Performance Analysis**: Test execution optimization through state reuse
