# Lesson 1: Parallel Testing with Playwright

Running tests sequentially can be time-consuming, especially for large test suites. Parallel testing is a powerful feature in Playwright that allows you to run multiple tests simultaneously, significantly reducing your test execution time.

## 1. How Parallelism Works in Playwright

Playwright runs tests in parallel by default. It creates multiple "worker" processes, and each worker runs a separate test file in its own browser context. This ensures that tests are isolated from each other.

## 2. Configuring Parallelism

You can control the number of worker processes in your `playwright.config.ts` file.

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  // The number of workers to use. Defaults to half of the CPU cores.
  workers: 4,
});
```

## 3. Sharding

For very large test suites, you can distribute the tests across multiple machines using a technique called "sharding." This is useful for CI/CD environments where you want to get feedback as quickly as possible.

```bash
# Run the first shard on machine 1
npx playwright test --shard=1/3

# Run the second shard on machine 2
npx playwright test --shard=2/3

# Run the third shard on machine 3
npx playwright test --shard=3/3
```

## 4. Best Practices for Parallel Testing

- **Ensure Test Independence:** Your tests should not depend on each other. Each test should be able to run on its own without relying on the state of another test.
- **Use Atomic Operations:** Avoid shared resources that can cause conflicts between tests. If you need to interact with a database, make sure each test uses its own set of data.
- **Manage Test Data Carefully:** If your tests create data, make sure they also clean up after themselves to avoid interfering with other tests.
