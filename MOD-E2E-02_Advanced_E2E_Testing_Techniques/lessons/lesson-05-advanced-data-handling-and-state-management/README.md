# Lesson 5: Advanced Data Handling and State Management

## Lesson Overview

This lesson delves into advanced techniques for managing test data and application state in E2E tests. You will learn how to create, manage, and tear down test data programmatically, and how to manipulate application state directly to create specific scenarios for testing, leading to more robust and efficient tests.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Understand the importance of isolating test data.
-   Use API calls to seed a database with required data before a test.
-   Implement data cleanup strategies to ensure tests are independent.
-   Inject state into an application using browser storage (localStorage, sessionStorage).
-   Combine API mocking with state manipulation for comprehensive scenario testing.
