# Lesson 2: Handling Complex Authentication Flows

## Lesson Overview

This lesson focuses on strategies for managing authentication in Playwright tests. You will learn how to handle various complex authentication scenarios, including multi-factor authentication (MFA), social logins (OAuth), and session management, to ensure your tests can access protected routes efficiently and reliably.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Understand the challenges of testing authenticated applications.
-   Implement a reusable authentication flow using global setup files.
-   Save and reuse authentication state to speed up test execution.
-   Mock authentication tokens or cookies for faster, more isolated tests.
-   Discuss strategies for handling MFA and third-party logins in a test environment.
