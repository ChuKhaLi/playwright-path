## Question 1: Basic Object Type Definition

You need to create a type for test user data. Which approach is MOST appropriate for a reusable user type in test automation?

**A)** 
```typescript
function createUser(user: { name: string; email: string; age: number }) {
  return user;
}
```

**B)** 
```typescript
type User = {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  age: number;
};
```

**C)** 
```typescript
const user = {
  name: "string",
  email: "string",
  age: "number"
};
```

**D)** 
```typescript
interface User {
  name;
  email;
  age;
}
```

### Explanation

**Correct Answer: B**

**Why B is correct:**
- Creates a reusable type alias that can be used throughout the codebase
- Properly defines the structure with explicit type annotations
- Follows TypeScript best practices for type definitions
- Can be imported and used in multiple files
- Provides clear documentation of the expected object structure

**Why other options are less ideal:**
- **A)** Inline object type is not reusable and must be repeated everywhere
- **C)** Creates a value object, not a type definition, and uses incorrect syntax
- **D)** Missing type annotations for properties, which would cause TypeScript errors

**Key Learning:** Use type aliases or interfaces to create reusable object type definitions that can be shared across your test automation codebase.

## Question 2: Optional Properties in Test Data

You're creating a test data type for a registration form where some fields are optional. Which type definition is MOST appropriate?

**A)** 
```typescript
type RegistrationData = {
  email: string;
  password: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  phone: string;
  newsletter: boolean;
};
```

**B)** 
```typescript
type RegistrationData = {
  email: string;
  password: string;
  firstName?: string;
  lastName?: string;
  phone?: string;
  newsletter?: boolean;
};
```

**C)** 
```typescript
type RegistrationData = {
  email: string;
  password: string;
  firstName: string | undefined;
  lastName: string | undefined;
  phone: string | undefined;
  newsletter: boolean | undefined;
};
```

**D)** 
```typescript
type RegistrationData = {
  required: {
    email: string;
    password: string;
  };
  optional: {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    phone: string;
    newsletter: boolean;
  };
};
```

### Explanation

**Correct Answer: B**

**Why B is correct:**
- Uses the `?` operator to properly mark optional properties
- Allows objects to be created with only required fields
- Follows TypeScript conventions for optional properties
- Enables flexible test data creation for different scenarios
- Provides type safety while maintaining flexibility

**Why other options are less ideal:**
- **A)** Makes all properties required, reducing flexibility for test scenarios
- **C)** Uses union types with undefined, which is more verbose and requires explicit undefined values
- **D)** Creates unnecessary nesting that complicates object creation and usage

**Key Learning:** Use the `?` operator for optional properties to create flexible object types that can handle different test data scenarios.

## Question 3: Readonly Properties for Configuration

You're creating a test environment configuration type where some properties should never be modified after initialization. Which approach is BEST?

**A)** 
```typescript
type TestConfig = {
  environmentName: string;
  baseUrl: string;
  apiKey: string;
  timeout: number;
  retries: number;
};
```

**B)** 
```typescript
type TestConfig = {
  readonly environmentName: string;
  readonly baseUrl: string;
  readonly apiKey: string;
  timeout: number;
  retries: number;
};
```

**C)** 
```typescript
type TestConfig = {
  environmentName: string;
  baseUrl: string;
  apiKey: string;
  readonly timeout: number;
  readonly retries: number;
};
```

**D)** 
```typescript
const TestConfig = {
  environmentName: "prod",
  baseUrl: "https://api.example.com",
  apiKey: "secret",
  timeout: 5000,
  retries: 3
} as const;
```

### Explanation

**Correct Answer: B**

**Why B is correct:**
- Uses `readonly` modifier for configuration properties that shouldn't change
- Protects critical environment settings from accidental modification
- Allows runtime settings (timeout, retries) to remain mutable
- Provides compile-time protection against configuration tampering
- Follows the principle of immutable configuration with mutable runtime settings

**Why other options are less ideal:**
- **A)** No protection against accidental modification of critical configuration
- **C)** Makes runtime settings readonly, which reduces flexibility for test execution
- **D)** Creates a constant object rather than a type, limiting reusability

**Key Learning:** Use `readonly` properties to protect critical configuration data while keeping runtime settings mutable.

## Question 4: Index Signatures for API Responses

You're handling API responses that have known properties but may also contain additional dynamic properties. Which type definition is MOST flexible and type-safe?

**A)** 
```typescript
type ApiResponse = {
  success: boolean;
  message: string;
  data: any;
};
```

**B)** 
```typescript
type ApiResponse = {
  success: boolean;
  message: string;
  [key: string]: any;
};
```

**C)** 
```typescript
type ApiResponse = {
  success: boolean;
  message: string;
  data?: any;
  [key: string]: any;
};
```

**D)** 
```typescript
type ApiResponse<T = any> = {
  success: boolean;
  message: string;
  data?: T;
  [key: string]: any;
};
```

### Explanation

**Correct Answer: D**

**Why D is correct:**
- Uses generics to provide type safety for the data property
- Includes index signature for additional dynamic properties
- Makes data optional since not all responses may have data
- Provides flexibility while maintaining type safety where possible
- Allows for specific typing of response data when known

**Why other options are less ideal:**
- **A)** No support for additional dynamic properties, limited flexibility
- **B)** Lacks explicit data property, less clear about expected structure
- **C)** Better than A and B but lacks generic typing for data property

**Key Learning:** Combine generics with index signatures to create flexible yet type-safe API response types.

## Question 5: Nested Object Types for Page Objects

You're creating a page object type with nested element selectors and test data. Which structure is MOST organized and maintainable?

**A)** 
```typescript
type LoginPage = {
  usernameInput: string;
  passwordInput: string;
  submitButton: string;
  errorMessage: string;
  validUsername: string;
  validPassword: string;
  invalidUsername: string;
  invalidPassword: string;
};
```

**B)** 
```typescript
type LoginPage = {
  elements: {
    usernameInput: string;
    passwordInput: string;
    submitButton: string;
    errorMessage: string;
  };
  testData: {
    valid: { username: string; password: string };
    invalid: { username: string; password: string };
  };
};
```

**C)** 
```typescript
type LoginPage = {
  selectors: string[];
  data: Record<string, any>;
};
```

**D)** 
```typescript
type LoginPage = {
  elements: string;
  testData: string;
};
```

### Explanation

**Correct Answer: B**

**Why B is correct:**
- Logically groups related properties (elements vs test data)
- Creates clear separation between selectors and test data
- Provides nested structure that's easy to navigate and understand
- Follows page object model best practices
- Makes the code more maintainable and self-documenting

**Why other options are less ideal:**
- **A)** Flat structure mixes selectors and test data, harder to organize
- **C)** Too generic, loses type safety and clear structure
- **D)** Incorrect types (string instead of object), no useful structure

**Key Learning:** Use nested object types to create logical groupings and improve code organization in page object models.

## Question 6: Type Safety and Validation

You need to create a function that safely processes user data that might come from an external API. Which approach provides the BEST type safety?

**A)** 
```typescript
function processUser(data: any) {
  return `User: ${data.name} (${data.email})`;
}
```

**B)** 
```typescript
function processUser(data: User) {
  return `User: ${data.name} (${data.email})`;
}
```

**C)** 
```typescript
function processUser(data: unknown): string | null {
  if (isValidUser(data)) {
    return `User: ${data.name} (${data.email})`;
  }
  return null;
}

function isValidUser(obj: any): obj is User {
  return obj && typeof obj.name === 'string' && typeof obj.email === 'string';
}
```

**D)** 
```typescript
function processUser(data: Partial<User>) {
  return `User: ${data.name || 'Unknown'} (${data.email || 'No email'})`;
}
```

### Explanation

**Correct Answer: C**

**Why C is correct:**
- Uses type guards to safely validate unknown data at runtime
- Provides both compile-time and runtime type safety
- Handles the case where data might not match expected structure
- Returns null for invalid data, making error handling explicit
- Follows TypeScript best practices for handling external data

**Why other options are less ideal:**
- **A)** Uses `any` type, completely bypasses type checking
- **B)** Assumes data is valid without runtime validation, unsafe for external data
- **D)** Uses `Partial<User>` but doesn't handle undefined properties safely

**Key Learning:** Use type guards with unknown types to safely validate and process external data in TypeScript.

## Bonus Question: Advanced Object Type Patterns

You're designing a comprehensive test case type that needs to handle different types of test data, optional metadata, and extensible properties. Which approach demonstrates BEST practices?

**A)** 
```typescript
type TestCase = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  steps: string[];
  data: any;
  metadata: any;
};
```

**B)** 
```typescript
type TestCase<TData = Record<string, any>> = {
  readonly id: string;
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  steps: Array<{
    action: string;
    expectedResult: string;
    data?: TData;
  }>;
  testData: {
    valid: TData;
    invalid?: TData;
    boundary?: TData;
  };
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
  [customProperty: string]: any;
};
```

**C)** 
```typescript
type TestCase = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  steps: { action: string; result: string }[];
  testData: { valid: object; invalid: object };
};
```

**D)** 
```typescript
interface TestCase {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  execute(): void;
}
```

### Explanation

**Correct Answer: B**

**Why B is correct:**
- Uses generics for flexible test data typing
- Combines readonly properties for immutable identifiers
- Includes optional properties for flexible usage
- Uses union types for constrained values (priority)
- Provides nested object structure for complex data
- Includes index signature for extensibility
- Demonstrates multiple advanced TypeScript features working together

**Why other options are less ideal:**
- **A)** Uses `any` types, loses type safety benefits
- **C)** Too simplistic, uses generic `object` type instead of specific typing
- **D)** Focuses on behavior rather than data structure, incomplete for the use case

**Key Learning:** Advanced object types can combine multiple TypeScript features (generics, readonly, optional properties, union types, nested objects, index signatures) to create powerful and flexible type definitions.
