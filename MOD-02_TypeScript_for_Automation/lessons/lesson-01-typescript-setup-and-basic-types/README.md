# Lesson 01: TypeScript Setup and Basic Types

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- **LO-1.1**: Set up a TypeScript development environment for automation testing
- **LO-1.2**: Explain the benefits of static typing in test automation
- **LO-1.3**: Use basic TypeScript types (string, number, boolean, array) with proper annotations
- **LO-1.4**: Apply type inference and explicit typing appropriately in testing contexts
- **LO-1.5**: Configure TypeScript compiler options for testing projects

## üìã Lesson Overview

**Duration**: 1-2 hours  
**Prerequisites**: MOD-01 completion, basic programming knowledge  
**Difficulty**: Beginner  

This foundational lesson introduces TypeScript and its benefits for test automation. You'll learn to set up a TypeScript environment and understand the basic type system that forms the foundation for all subsequent lessons.

### What You'll Learn

1. **TypeScript vs JavaScript**: Understanding the key differences and benefits
2. **Environment Setup**: Installing and configuring TypeScript for testing
3. **Basic Type System**: Working with primitive types and arrays
4. **Type Annotations**: When and how to use explicit typing
5. **Compiler Configuration**: Basic tsconfig.json setup for testing

### What You'll Build

- A TypeScript development environment
- Basic typed utility functions for testing
- Simple test data structures with proper typing
- Your first TypeScript testing utilities

## üîß Technical Requirements

### Software Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Command line access
- Git (for version control)

### Recommended VS Code Extensions
- TypeScript Importer
- TypeScript Hero
- Error Lens
- Prettier - Code formatter

## üìö Lesson Structure

### Part 1: Introduction and Setup (30 minutes)
- Understanding TypeScript benefits for testing
- Installing TypeScript and development tools
- Setting up your first TypeScript project

### Part 2: Basic Types and Annotations (45 minutes)
- Primitive types: string, number, boolean
- Array types and type annotations
- Type inference vs explicit typing
- Best practices for testing contexts

### Part 3: Practical Application (30 minutes)
- Creating typed test data
- Building basic utility functions
- Configuring TypeScript for testing projects

### Part 4: Hands-on Exercise (15 minutes)
- Complete practical coding challenges
- Apply concepts to real testing scenarios

## üéì Assessment Methods

### Knowledge Check (10 minutes)
- Multiple choice questions on TypeScript concepts
- True/false questions on type system benefits
- Short answer questions on setup procedures

### Practical Exercise (20 minutes)
- Set up TypeScript project from scratch
- Create typed variables and functions
- Configure basic compiler options

### Application Task (15 minutes)
- Build simple test data structures
- Create utility functions with proper typing
- Demonstrate understanding through code examples

## üìñ Key Concepts

### TypeScript Benefits for Testing
- **Early Error Detection**: Catch errors at compile time
- **Better IDE Support**: Enhanced autocomplete and refactoring
- **Code Documentation**: Types serve as inline documentation
- **Refactoring Safety**: Confident code changes with type checking

### Basic Type System
- **Primitive Types**: string, number, boolean, null, undefined
- **Array Types**: number[], string[], Array<T>
- **Type Annotations**: Explicit type declarations
- **Type Inference**: Automatic type detection

### Testing Applications
- **Test Data Typing**: Structured test data with proper types
- **Utility Functions**: Typed helper functions for testing
- **Configuration Objects**: Typed configuration for test frameworks
- **API Response Types**: Basic typing for API testing scenarios

## üîó Connections to Other Lessons

### Prerequisites
- **MOD-01**: Web technologies foundation
- **Basic Programming**: Variables, functions, objects

### Prepares For
- **Lesson 02**: Object types and complex structures
- **Lesson 03**: Function types and signatures
- **All Future Lessons**: TypeScript foundation for advanced concepts

### Real-World Applications
- Setting up TypeScript in testing projects
- Creating typed test utilities
- Configuring development environments
- Building maintainable test code

## üí° Study Tips

### Before the Lesson
