/**
 * Exercise: Basic Types
 *
 * This exercise is designed to help you practice with TypeScript's basic types.
 * Your goal is to correctly annotate the variables below with the appropriate types.
 *
 * Follow the instructions in the comments for each variable.
 */

// 1. Declare a variable named 'testName' and assign it a string value.
//    Add the correct type annotation for a string.
let testName = "Sample Test Case";

// 2. Declare a variable named 'numberOfTests' and assign it a number.
//    Add the correct type annotation for a number.
let numberOfTests = 50;

// 3. Declare a variable named 'isTestPassing' and assign it a boolean value.
//    Add the correct type annotation for a boolean.
let isTestPassing = true;

// 4. Declare a variable named 'averageTime' and assign it a floating-point number.
//    Add the correct type annotation for a number.
let averageTime = 15.7;

// 5. Declare a variable named 'testDescription' and assign it a multi-line string.
//    Add the correct type annotation for a string.
let testDescription = `
  This test validates the login functionality
  with a valid username and password.
`;

/**
 * After you have added the correct type annotations, try to assign a value of a different type
 * to each variable. Observe the error that the TypeScript compiler gives you.
 *
 * For example:
 * testName = 123; // This should show a type error
