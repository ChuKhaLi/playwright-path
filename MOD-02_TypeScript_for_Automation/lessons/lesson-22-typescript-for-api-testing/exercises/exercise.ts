// 1. Define an interface or type for a Post object from jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts.
// 2. Create an async function to fetch all posts and return them as an array of the type you defined.
// 3. Create an async function that takes a post object (of the type you defined) and sends a POST request to create a new post.
// 4. Create an async function that calls the fetch function, takes the first post from the array, modifies its title, and then calls the create post function with the modified post.
