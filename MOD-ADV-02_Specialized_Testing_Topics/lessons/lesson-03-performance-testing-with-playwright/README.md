# Lesson 3: Performance Testing with Playwright

## Introduction

Welcome to the third lesson, where we shift our focus from visual perfection to application performance. While Playwright is primarily a functional testing tool, it provides powerful features that allow us to capture and analyze performance metrics.

In this lesson, you will learn how to measure key performance indicators (KPIs) like page load times, resource loading, and other client-side metrics. This will enable you to identify performance bottlenecks directly within your E2E testing suite.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- **Understand** the role of client-side performance testing.
- **Identify** key performance metrics available through Playwright.
- **Use** Playwright's built-in tracing to analyze performance.
- **Measure** page load times and resource loading performance.
- **Integrate** basic performance checks into your functional tests.
