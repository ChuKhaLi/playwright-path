### Question 4

How does Visual AI differ from traditional pixel-by-pixel visual testing?

a) It is faster but less accurate.
b) It can only test black and white images.
c) It uses machine learning to understand the structure and content of a page, reducing false positives from dynamic content.
d) It does not require baseline images.

**Answer:** c) It uses machine learning to understand the structure and content of a page, reducing false positives from dynamic content.
