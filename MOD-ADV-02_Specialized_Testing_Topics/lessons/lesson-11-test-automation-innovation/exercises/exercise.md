# Exercise: Designing a Modern Testing Strategy

## Objective

To think critically about how to apply the concepts of modern test automation to a real-world project.

## Scenario

You have just been hired as the first QA Automation Engineer for a startup called "ConnectSphere," which is building a new social media platform. The platform has a web application, a mobile app, and a backend built with microservices.

The development team is small and agile, and they want to build a culture of quality from the ground up.

## Your Task

Write a brief document (a few paragraphs for each point) outlining your proposed testing strategy for ConnectSphere. Address the following points, incorporating the concepts you learned in this lesson.

1.  **Shift-Left Approach:** How would you involve quality checks early in the development process? What would you recommend the developers do before they even merge their code?

2.  **Automation Strategy:** What types of automated tests would you implement? Where would you focus your efforts with Playwright? Would you consider AI-powered tools?

3.  **Shift-Right Approach:** How would you ensure the application is working correctly in production? What would you monitor?

4.  **Your Role:** How do you see your role as a QA Automation Engineer on this team? What would be your primary responsibilities beyond just writing test scripts?

## Example Answers (for your reference)

### 1. Shift-Left Approach

I would propose integrating automated quality gates directly into our CI/CD pipeline. On every pull request, we would automatically run static code analysis, unit tests, and a core suite of API contract tests. I would also work with the frontend developers to add a component testing framework where they can test UI components in isolation. My goal is to provide feedback to developers in minutes, not hours.

### 2. Automation Strategy

My primary focus for Playwright would be on E2E tests for critical user journeys: user registration, posting a message, and adding a friend. I would keep this E2E suite small and fast. For visual testing, I would recommend a Visual AI tool to avoid the maintenance overhead of pixel-based comparisons, especially since the UI will be changing rapidly. We would rely heavily on unit and integration tests written by developers for detailed business logic validation.

### 3. Shift-Right Approach

For production, I would implement synthetic monitoring using a few of our key Playwright E2E scripts. These would run every 15 minutes against production to ensure our main user flows are always operational. I would also work with the DevOps team to set up alerts on key performance indicators (like API error rates and latency) and integrate our frontend with an error tracking tool like Sentry.

### 4. Your Role

My role would be that of a Quality Architect. I would be responsible for building and maintaining the test automation infrastructure, but my primary goal would be to empower developers to test their own code effectively. I would create testing libraries, shareable workflows, and provide training. I would also be responsible for analyzing all the data from our testing and monitoring tools to identify trends and help the team focus on the most impactful quality improvements.
