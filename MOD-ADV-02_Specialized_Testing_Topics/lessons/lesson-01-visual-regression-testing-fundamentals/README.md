# Lesson 1: Visual Regression Testing Fundamentals

## Introduction

Welcome to the first lesson in our Specialized Testing module. This lesson introduces the concept of Visual Regression Testing, a critical technique for ensuring that the user interface (UI) of an application remains consistent and visually perfect after code changes.

We will explore what visual bugs are, why they are challenging to catch with traditional functional tests, and how automated screenshot comparisons can help maintain a high-quality user experience.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- **Define** Visual Regression Testing and explain its importance in modern web development.
- **Identify** common types of visual bugs that can impact user experience.
- **Understand** the core concepts behind automated screenshot comparison.
- **Set up** a basic Playwright project configured for visual testing.
- **Write** your first visual regression test to capture and compare a baseline screenshot.
