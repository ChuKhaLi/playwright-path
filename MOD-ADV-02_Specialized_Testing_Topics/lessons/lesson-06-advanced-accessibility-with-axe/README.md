# Lesson 6: Advanced Accessibility with Axe

## Introduction

Building on the fundamentals, this lesson dives into the advanced capabilities of the Axe accessibility testing engine. We will explore how to configure Axe to suit our specific testing needs, such as focusing on certain WCAG conformance levels, disabling specific rules, or testing only a part of a page.

These advanced techniques will help you create a more targeted and efficient accessibility testing strategy, reducing noise and focusing on the issues that matter most to your project.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- **Configure** the AxeBuilder to target specific WCAG standards (A, AA, AAA).
- **Disable** specific rules to ignore known, accepted issues.
- **Scan** a specific component or element on a page instead of the entire document.
- **Include** or **exclude** elements from a scan using CSS selectors.
- **Integrate** advanced accessibility scans into complex user-flow tests.
