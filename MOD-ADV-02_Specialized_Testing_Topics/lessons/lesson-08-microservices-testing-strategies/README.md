# Lesson 8: Microservices Testing Strategies

## Introduction

Modern applications are often built using a microservices architecture, where the application is broken down into a collection of smaller, independent services. While this offers scalability and flexibility, it introduces new challenges for testing.

In this lesson, we will explore strategies for testing applications built with microservices. We will focus on how Playwright can be used for end-to-end testing across multiple services and how to handle service dependencies.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- **Understand** the challenges of testing in a microservices architecture.
- **Differentiate** between different levels of testing (unit, integration, contract, E2E).
- **Use** Playwright for end-to-end testing of user journeys that span multiple services.
- **Mock** API requests to isolate services during testing.
- **Develop** a testing strategy that balances coverage, speed, and reliability.
