# Lesson 4: Lighthouse Integration for Advanced Performance

## Introduction

In this lesson, we will take our performance testing to the next level by integrating Google's Lighthouse, an open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages. Lighthouse provides a comprehensive audit of performance, accessibility, SEO, and more.

By integrating Lighthouse with Playwright, we can automate these audits and track our scores over time, ensuring that our application not only performs well but also adheres to best practices.

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- **Understand** what Lighthouse is and the key metrics it provides.
- **Install** and **configure** the necessary packages to run Lighthouse with Playwright.
- **Write** a Playwright test that executes a Lighthouse audit.
