# Lesson 12: Assessment

## Project Evaluation Criteria

This capstone project will be evaluated based on the following criteria. Use this as a checklist to ensure your project is complete and meets the learning objectives.

### 1. Code Quality and Structure (25%)

-   **Project Setup:** The Playwright project is well-structured, with a clear separation of tests, configurations, and reports.
-   **Readability:** The code is clean, well-commented, and easy to understand.
-   **Best Practices:** The project follows the best practices for Playwright and TypeScript taught throughout the course (e.g., using locators, async/await, strong typing).

### 2. Test Implementation (40%)

-   **Correctness:** The tests accurately implement the requirements of the chosen specialization track.
-   **Robustness:** The tests are reliable and not flaky. Locators are well-chosen.
-   **Assertions:** The tests contain meaningful assertions that correctly validate the application's state.
-   **Completeness:** The project fulfills all the tasks outlined in the chosen track.

### 3. Strategy and Analysis (25%)

-   **README Document:** The `README.md` file is comprehensive and clearly explains:
    -   The chosen application and why it was selected.
    -   The chosen specialization track.
    -   The overall testing strategy.
    -   A summary of the findings (e.g., bugs found, performance scores, accessibility violations).
-   **Justification:** The student can justify their testing decisions (e.g., why they chose to test a specific component or ignore a certain rule).

### 4. Presentation and Portfolio-Worthiness (10%)

-   **GitHub Repository:** The project is hosted in a clean, professional-looking public GitHub repository.
-   **Clarity:** It is easy for a potential employer to understand the project's purpose and see the student's skills in action.
-   **Demonstration:** The project includes evidence of the tests running (e.g., screenshots, GIFs, or a video in the README).

## Self-Assessment Questions

Before submitting your project, ask yourself these questions:

-   [ ] Does my project have a clear and descriptive `README.md`?
-   [ ] Have I fulfilled all the requirements for my chosen specialization track?
-   [ ] Is my code well-organized and easy for someone else to read?
-   [ ] If someone cloned my repository, could they easily understand how to run the tests?
-   [ ] Does my project effectively showcase the advanced testing skills I learned in this module?
