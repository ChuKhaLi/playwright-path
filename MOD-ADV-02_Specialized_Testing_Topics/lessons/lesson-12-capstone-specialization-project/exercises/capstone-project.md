# Capstone Project: Your Specialization

## 1. Your Mission

Your mission is to create a new, public GitHub repository and build a specialized test suite for a web application of your choice. This project will be the culmination of all the advanced topics covered in this module.

## 2. Steps to Success

### Step 1: Choose Your Application

-   **Select a public website.** As recommended in the lesson content, choose a site that is complex enough to be interesting but not so complex that it's impossible to test.
-   **Document your choice:** In your project's `README.md`, write a short paragraph about the application you chose and why.

### Step 2: Choose Your Specialization Track

-   **Select one track:** Choose from "Visual Quality Expert," "Performance and Accessibility Advocate," or "Security-Minded Tester."
-   **Declare your track:** State clearly in your `README.md` which track you have chosen.

### Step 3: Set Up Your Project

-   **Initialize Playwright:** Create a new local directory, run `npm init playwright@latest`, and initialize a new Git repository.
-   **Install Dependencies:** Based on your track, install any additional dependencies you might need (e.g., `playwright-lighthouse`, `axe-playwright`).
-   **Push to GitHub:** Create a new public repository on your GitHub account and push your initial project structure.

### Step 4: Implement Your Test Suite

-   **Write the tests:** Following the tasks outlined for your chosen track in the lesson content, write your Playwright tests.
-   **Focus on quality:** Ensure your code is clean, readable, and well-structured. Use comments to explain complex parts of your tests.
-   **Commit your work:** Make regular, meaningful commits to your repository.

### Step 5: Document Your Project

-   **Write a great `README.md`:** This is the most important part of your project's presentation. It should include:
    -   A clear project title and a brief description.
    -   The application under test.
    -   Your chosen specialization track.
    -   Instructions on how to install dependencies and run your tests.
    -   A summary of your test strategy.
    -   **Your findings!** Include screenshots of test reports, baseline images, Lighthouse scores, or descriptions of accessibility/security issues you found. This is your chance to show what you discovered.

### Step 6: Showcase Your Work

-   **Add visuals:** Make your `README.md` engaging by adding screenshots, GIFs, or even a link to a short YouTube video of your tests running.
-   **Final Polish:** Review your repository to make sure it looks professional and is easy to navigate.

## 3. Final Deliverable

A public GitHub repository containing:
-   A fully functional Playwright test suite for your chosen specialization.
-   A comprehensive `README.md` file that documents your project thoroughly.
-   All necessary configuration files (`playwright.config.ts`, `package.json`, etc.).
-   Any generated reports or baseline images that are relevant to your project.

Good luck! This is your opportunity to demonstrate your expertise in specialized test automation.
