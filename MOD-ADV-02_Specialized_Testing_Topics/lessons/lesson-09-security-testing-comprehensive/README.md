# Lesson 9: Comprehensive Security Testing

## Introduction

Application security is a critical aspect of software quality that cannot be overlooked. While Playwright is not a dedicated security testing tool, it can be used to automate checks for common web vulnerabilities from the user's perspective.

In this lesson, we will introduce the fundamentals of web security testing and demonstrate how to use Playwright to probe for potential security gaps in your application's authentication, authorization, and data handling.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- **Understand** common web security vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF, broken access control).
- **Recognize** the role of automated testing in a security strategy.
- **Use** Playwright to test for authentication and authorization issues.
- **Write** tests to check for insecure data exposure on the frontend.
- **Integrate** basic security checks into your E2E test suite.
