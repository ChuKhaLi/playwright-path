# Lesson 2: Advanced Visual Testing Integration

## Introduction

In this lesson, we will build upon the fundamentals of visual regression testing and explore advanced techniques for a more robust and scalable testing strategy. We will cover how to handle dynamic data, manage tests across multiple browsers and viewports, and organize your visual testing suite effectively.

We will also discuss strategies for integrating visual tests into a CI/CD pipeline to catch visual bugs automatically before they reach production.
