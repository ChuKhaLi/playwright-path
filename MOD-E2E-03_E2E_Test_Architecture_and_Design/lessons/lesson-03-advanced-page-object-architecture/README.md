# Lesson 3: Advanced Page Object Architecture

## Overview

The Page Object Model (POM) is a fundamental pattern in test automation, but its simple form has limitations in large, complex applications. This lesson explores advanced architectural patterns for your Page Objects to make them more powerful, maintainable, and scalable. We will cover concepts like component-based page objects, fluent interfaces, and separating actions from assertions.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

- **Implement** a component-based approach to Page Objects for reusable UI parts.
- **Design** Page Objects with fluent interfaces to create more readable tests.
- **Separate** actions and assertions within the Page Object architecture.
- **Create** a `BasePage` to share common functionality.
- **Understand** how to handle complex page states and dynamic elements.
