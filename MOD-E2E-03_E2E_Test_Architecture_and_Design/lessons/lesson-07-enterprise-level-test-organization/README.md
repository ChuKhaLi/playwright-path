# Lesson 7: Enterprise-Level Test Organization

## Overview

As a test suite grows to hundreds or thousands of tests across multiple teams, organization becomes paramount. This lesson focuses on strategies for organizing tests, code, and ownership in a large-scale, enterprise environment. We will cover test categorization, code ownership, and how to structure your framework to support contributions from multiple developers and QA engineers.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

- **Implement** a robust test categorization strategy using tags.
- **Design** a directory structure that scales for multiple teams and features.
- **Define** code ownership and maintain quality using `CODEOWNERS` files.
- **Develop** a strategy for running different test suites for different purposes (e.g., smoke, regression, feature-specific).
- **Architect** a monorepo or multi-repo approach for test code.
