# Lesson 9: Test Execution Strategies

## 1. The Importance of Smart Test Execution

How you run your tests is just as important as how you write them. An effective execution strategy can help you get faster feedback, optimize your use of resources, and catch bugs earlier in the development process.

## 2. Local vs. CI/CD Execution

- **Local Execution:** When you're developing a new test or debugging a failure, you'll typically run a single test or a small group of tests on your local machine. This is optimized for speed and debugging.
- **CI/CD Execution:** In your Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline, you'll run a larger suite of tests automatically, often triggered by a code change. This is optimized for coverage and reliability.

## 3. Parallel Execution and Sharding

Playwright is designed to run tests in parallel, which can dramatically reduce your test execution time.

- **Parallelism:** Playwright runs test files in parallel by default. You can control the number of parallel workers in your `playwright.config.ts`.
- **Sharding:** For very large test suites, you can "shard" your test run across multiple machines. Each machine runs a fraction of the total test suite. This is a powerful way to get feedback from a full regression run in minutes instead of hours.

**Configuring Sharding in CI:**
```yaml
# In your GitHub Actions workflow
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        shard: [1/4, 2/4, 3/4, 4/4]
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
    - run: npm ci
    - run: npx playwright test --shard=${{ matrix.shard }}
```

## 4. Test Selection Strategies

You don't always need to run your entire test suite.

- **Smoke Tests:** A small, fast-running suite of tests that covers the most critical functionality of your application. This should be run on every code change.
- **Regression Tests:** The full test suite, which is typically run before a release or on a nightly schedule.
- **Tag-Based Execution:** Use tags (`@smoke`, `@regression`, `@feature-X`) to run a specific subset of tests.
- **Run Tests Related to a Change:** More advanced strategies can analyze a code change and only run the tests that are relevant to the files that were changed.

## 5. Retries and Flakiness Management

- **Automatic Retries:** Configure Playwright to automatically retry failed tests. This can help you get a passing build even if you have some intermittent failures (flakiness).
- **Flakiness Detection:** A good reporting tool (like Allure or ReportPortal) can help you identify your most flaky tests.
- **Prioritize Fixing Flakiness:** Flaky tests erode trust in your test suite. You should have a process for regularly identifying and fixing them.

## 6. Conclusion

An effective test execution strategy is a key part of a mature automation practice. By leveraging parallelism, sharding, and smart test selection, you can get the feedback you need, when you need it, without waiting for hours. This allows your team to move faster and with more confidence.
