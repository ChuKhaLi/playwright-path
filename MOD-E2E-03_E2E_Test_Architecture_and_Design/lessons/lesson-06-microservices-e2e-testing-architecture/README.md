# Lesson 6: Microservices E2E Testing Architecture

## Overview

Testing applications built with a microservices architecture presents unique challenges. Traditional end-to-end testing can be slow, brittle, and difficult to debug. This lesson explores modern architectural approaches for testing in a microservices environment, focusing on how to gain confidence in the system as a whole without the pain of traditional E2E tests. We will cover contract testing, targeted E2E scenarios, and how to leverage Playwright for both UI and API validation within the same framework.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

- **Understand** the challenges of testing microservices.
- **Explain** the concept of contract testing and its role in a microservices strategy.
- **Design** a testing strategy that combines component, integration, contract, and E2E tests.
- **Implement** API-level tests using Playwright to validate service interactions.
- **Architect** a framework that supports both UI and API tests for targeted E2E scenarios.
