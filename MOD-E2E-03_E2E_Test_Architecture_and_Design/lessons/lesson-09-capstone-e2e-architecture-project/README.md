# Lesson 9: Capstone E2E Architecture Project

## Overview

Welcome to the final lesson and capstone project for the E2E Test Architecture and Design module. This project is your opportunity to apply all the advanced concepts you have learned throughout this module to design and build a complete, enterprise-grade test automation framework from scratch. You will be architecting a solution for a full-featured demo application, making key design decisions and justifying your approach.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

- **Synthesize** all the architectural principles and patterns from this module into a cohesive project.
- **Design** a complete test framework architecture for a complex web application.
- **Implement** a scalable and maintainable framework using advanced POM, data management, and CI/CD strategies.
- **Justify** your architectural decisions in a clear and professional manner.
- **Produce** a portfolio-worthy project that demonstrates your expertise in E2E test architecture.
