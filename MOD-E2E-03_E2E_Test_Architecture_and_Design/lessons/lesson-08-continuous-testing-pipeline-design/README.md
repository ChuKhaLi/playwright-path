# Lesson 8: Continuous Testing Pipeline Design

## Overview

A test automation framework provides the most value when it's integrated into a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. This lesson focuses on the architectural design of a continuous testing pipeline. We will cover how to structure your pipeline, trigger test runs effectively, manage test environments, and optimize for speed and feedback.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

- **Design** a multi-stage CI/CD pipeline for continuous testing.
- **Implement** different test execution strategies for various triggers (e.g., pull requests vs. nightly builds).
- **Architect** a solution for provisioning and managing dynamic test environments.
- **Optimize** pipeline performance using parallelization, sharding, and caching.
- **Integrate** test reporting and notifications into the CI/CD workflow.
