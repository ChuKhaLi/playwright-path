# Lesson 01: Page Object Model Fundamentals

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- **Understand** the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern and its benefits
- **Implement** basic page object classes with proper encapsulation
- **Create** maintainable page objects for common web elements
- **Apply** POM best practices for scalable E2E test automation
- **Refactor** existing tests to use the Page Object Model pattern

## 📋 Lesson Overview

**Duration**: 2-3 hours  
**Type**: Foundation - E2E Design Patterns  
**Prerequisites**: MOD-04 Advanced Playwright Techniques

The Page Object Model is a fundamental design pattern in E2E test automation that promotes maintainability, reusability, and readability. This lesson establishes the foundation for professional test architecture by teaching you to create well-structured page objects that encapsulate web page functionality.

## 📚 What You'll Learn

### **Core Concepts**
- Page Object Model principles and benefits
- Separation of concerns in test automation
- Encapsulation of page elements and actions
- Maintainable test code organization

### **Implementation Skills**

- Implementing page element locators
- Building page action methods
- Handling page navigation and state

### **Best Practices**
- Naming conventions for page objects
- Method organization and structure
- Error handling in page objects
- Testing page object implementations

## 🛠️ Practical Applications
