# Lesson 04: Test Data Management Strategies

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- **Design** comprehensive test data management strategies for both API and E2E testing
- **Implement** data factory and builder patterns for generating test data
- **Create** database integration strategies for test data setup and cleanup
- **Build** cross-layer data validation between API and E2E tests
- **Apply** data isolation and cleanup strategies for reliable testing

## 📋 Lesson Overview

**Duration**: 2-3 hours  
**Type**: **API Focus** - Data Architecture  
**Prerequisites**: Lesson 03 (API Client Architecture Patterns)

This lesson focuses on professional test data management strategies that work seamlessly across both API and E2E testing layers. You'll learn to create maintainable, scalable data management systems that ensure test reliability and isolation.

## 📚 What You'll Learn
