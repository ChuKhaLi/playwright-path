# Lesson 4: Test Data Management Strategies

## Overview

Test data is a critical component of any automation framework. Hardcoding data into tests makes them brittle and difficult to maintain. This lesson explores advanced strategies for managing test data effectively, ensuring your tests are robust, reusable, and independent. We will cover data creation, data isolation, and various data storage and retrieval methods.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

- **Understand** the challenges of test data management.
- **Implement** data-driven tests using external files (JSON/CSV).
- **Design** a "Test Data Factory" for creating dynamic, realistic test data.
- **Use** APIs to create and tear down test data for test isolation.
- **Evaluate** different data storage strategies (files, databases, APIs) and their trade-offs.
