## Knowledge Check

### Question 1
What is the primary benefit of using a Test Data Factory with a library like Faker.js?

a) It guarantees that tests will always pass.
b) It allows for the dynamic creation of large amounts of unique and realistic test data.
c) It stores test data in a secure, encrypted format.
d) It replaces the need for a database.

**Answer:** b) It allows for the dynamic creation of large amounts of unique and realistic test data.

### Question 2
What is the main goal of API-based data seeding and cleanup?

a) To test the API itself.
b) To avoid interacting with the UI altogether.
c) To achieve perfect test isolation by creating and destroying data for each specific test.
d) To make test data available to non-technical users.

**Answer:** c) To achieve perfect test isolation by creating and destroying data for each specific test.

### Question 3
Which of the following is a major *disadvantage* of hardcoding test data directly into your test scripts?

a) It makes the tests run faster.
b) It makes the tests brittle and difficult to maintain when data changes.
c) It requires an internet connection.
d) It is not supported by Playwright.

**Answer:** b) It makes the tests brittle and difficult to maintain when data changes.

### Question 4
In a data-driven test using a JSON file, what is the purpose of the `for` loop in the test script?

a) To loop through page elements.
b) To create multiple users.
c) To iterate through the data sets in the JSON file, running the same test logic for each data set.
d) To slow down the test for observation.

**Answer:** c) To iterate through the data sets in the JSON file, running the same test logic for each data set.

### Question 5
When would you choose to use an external CSV file over a JSON file for test data?

a) When the data needs to be hierarchical or nested.
b) When the data set is very large and needs to be easily edited by non-technical users in a spreadsheet program.
c) When you need to store images or other binary data.
d) When you are only testing with a single data set.

**Answer:** b) When the data set is very large and needs to be easily edited by non-technical users in a spreadsheet program.
