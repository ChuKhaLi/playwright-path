# Lesson 5: Cross-Platform Test Architecture

## Overview

Modern applications must work flawlessly across a wide range of browsers, devices, and operating systems. This lesson focuses on architectural strategies for building a test suite that can be reliably executed across different platforms. We will cover Playwright's powerful cross-platform features, how to handle platform-specific differences in your code, and how to design for responsive web applications.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, you will be able to:

- **Configure** Playwright projects to run tests across multiple browsers and mobile viewports.
- **Design** an architecture that accommodates differences between platforms.
- **Implement** platform-specific logic within your test framework.
- **Write** tests that are resilient to minor UI changes in responsive designs.
- **Strategize** which tests to run on which platforms to optimize your CI/CD pipeline.
