# MOD-E2E-03: E2E Test Architecture and Design

## 📚 Module Overview

This module focuses on the principles and practices of designing and building robust, scalable, and maintainable End-to-End (E2E) test automation frameworks. It goes beyond writing individual tests to cover the high-level architecture and design patterns that are essential for long-term success in test automation.

### 🎯 Learning Outcomes

By completing this module, you will:
- Understand core E2E test architecture principles and patterns.
- Design and implement scalable test frameworks.
- Master advanced Page Object Model (POM) architectures, including the use of components.
- Implement effective test data management strategies.
- Design test architectures that support cross-platform and responsive testing.
- Architect tests for microservices and other modern application architectures.
- Organize tests for large, enterprise-level applications.
- Design and implement continuous testing pipelines.
- Apply your knowledge in a capstone architecture project.

### ⏱️ Duration & Commitment

- **Total Duration**: 4-5 weeks
- **Time Commitment**: 12-15 hours per week
- **Total Lessons**: 9 comprehensive lessons
- **Prerequisites**: Completion of MOD-E2E-02.

### 🎯 Assessment Strategy

- **Architectural Reviews**: Design documents and diagrams will be reviewed for adherence to best practices.
- **Practical Implementation**: Building and refactoring a test framework based on architectural principles.
- **Capstone Project**: A final project where you design and implement a complete E2E test automation framework from scratch for a complex application.

### 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Review Prerequisites**: Ensure you have a strong command of the advanced topics from the previous E2E module.
2. **Familiarize Yourself with the Capstone Project**: The capstone project will be introduced early and will be the basis for many of the exercises.
3. **Begin Lesson 3.1**: Start with the core principles of E2E architecture.
