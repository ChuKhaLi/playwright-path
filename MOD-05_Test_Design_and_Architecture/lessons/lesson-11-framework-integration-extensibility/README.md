# Lesson 11: Framework Integration and Extensibility

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- **Design** extensible test framework architectures with plugin systems
- **Implement** integration patterns for third-party tools and services
- **Create** modular framework components that support customization
- **Build** plugin architectures for framework extensibility
- **Apply** integration best practices for scalable test automation

## 📋 Lesson Overview

**Duration**: 2-3 hours  
**Type**: E2E Focus - Framework Design  
**Prerequisites**: Lesson 10 (Test Reporting and Documentation)

This lesson focuses on creating extensible test frameworks that can integrate with various tools, support plugins, and adapt to changing requirements while maintaining stability and performance.
