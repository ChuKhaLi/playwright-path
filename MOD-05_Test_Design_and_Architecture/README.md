# MOD-05: Test Design and Architecture

## üèóÔ∏è Module Overview

This module focuses on professional test design patterns and architecture for both API and E2E testing. You'll learn to build scalable, maintainable test frameworks that can handle enterprise-level requirements.

**Duration**: 4-5 weeks | **Time Commitment**: 12-15 hours/week | **Prerequisites**: MOD-04

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- **Design and implement** the Page Object Model (POM) for E2E testing
- **Architect API client patterns** for scalable API test automation
- **Create unified test frameworks** that integrate API and E2E testing
- **Implement professional design patterns** in test automation
- **Build maintainable test data management** strategies
- **Design configuration systems** for multi-environment testing
- **Create custom fixtures and hooks** for advanced test scenarios
- **Implement comprehensive reporting** and documentation systems

## üìö Module Structure

### **Foundation Lessons (1-2, 5-6, 8, 10)**
- Page Object Model fundamentals and advanced patterns
- Utility functions, test organization, and configuration management
- Test reporting and documentation strategies

### **API Architecture Lessons (3, 4, 7)** ‚≠ê
- API client architecture patterns and design
- Test data management for API and E2E integration
- Professional design patterns for test automation

### **E2E Architecture Lessons (9, 11, 12)** ‚≠ê
