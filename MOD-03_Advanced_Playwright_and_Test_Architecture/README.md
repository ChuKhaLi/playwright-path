# MOD-03: Advanced Playwright and Test Architecture

## 📚 Module Overview

Welcome to the capstone module of the Playwright learning track. This module is designed to elevate your skills from basic test automation to designing, building, and maintaining sophisticated, enterprise-grade test automation frameworks. Where previous modules focused on the fundamentals, this module dives deep into advanced features, architectural patterns, and the strategic thinking required to build test suites that are robust, scalable, and maintainable.

### 🎯 Learning Outcomes

By completing this module, you will:
- Implement advanced locator strategies to create resilient tests.
- Design and build a scalable test framework using the Page Object Model and other architectural patterns.
- Configure Playwright for complex scenarios, including multiple environments and cross-browser testing.
- Automate complex UI interactions, including iframes, drag-and-drop, and file handling.
- Implement data-driven testing, visual regression testing, and front-end performance checks.
- Master advanced debugging techniques to quickly diagnose and resolve test failures.
- Architect a test suite that is built for scalability, parallelism, and long-term maintainability.
