# MOD-03: Advanced Playwright and Test Architecture

## Overview

Welcome to the capstone module of the Playwright learning track. This module is designed to elevate your skills from basic test automation to designing, building, and maintaining sophisticated, enterprise-grade test automation frameworks.

Where previous modules focused on the fundamentals, this module dives deep into advanced features, architectural patterns, and the strategic thinking required to build test suites that are robust, scalable, and maintainable.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this module, you will be able to:

- Implement advanced locator strategies to create resilient tests.
- Design and build a scalable test framework using the Page Object Model and other architectural patterns.
- Configure Playwright for complex scenarios, including multiple environments and cross-browser testing.
- Automate complex UI interactions, including iframes, drag-and-drop, and file handling.
- Implement data-driven testing, visual regression testing, and front-end performance checks.
- Master advanced debugging techniques to quickly diagnose and resolve test failures.
- Architect a test suite that is built for scalability, parallelism, and long-term maintainability.

## Lessons

This module is composed of 12 comprehensive lessons that build upon each other:

1.  **Lesson 1: Advanced Locator Strategies and Patterns** - Move beyond basic selectors to create flexible and resilient locators.
2.  **Lesson 2: Page Object Model (POM) Design Patterns** - Learn the industry-standard pattern for scalable UI test automation.
3.  **Lesson 3: Playwright Configuration and Environment Management** - Master `playwright.config.ts` to manage complex test runs.
4.  **Lesson 4: Advanced Browser Context and Session Handling** - Simulate multiple users and manage authentication state efficiently.
5.  **Lesson 5: Handling Complex UI Interactions** - Automate drag-and-drop, file uploads, iframes, and more.
6.  **Lesson 6: Playwright Test Fixtures and Hooks** - Use fixtures to create clean, declarative, and reusable test setups.
7.  **Lesson 7: Data-Driven Testing and Parameterization** - Cover more scenarios with less code by separating data from test logic.
8.  **Lesson 8: Visual Regression and Screenshot Testing** - Catch unintended visual bugs with pixel-perfect screenshot comparisons.
9.  **Lesson 9: Performance Testing with Playwright** - Integrate front-end performance checks into your test suite.
10. **Lesson 10: Cross-Browser and Device Testing** - Ensure your application works flawlessly on all major browsers and devices.
11. **Lesson 11: Test Architecture Patterns and Scalability** - Learn high-level strategies for building large-scale, maintainable frameworks.
12. **Lesson 12: Advanced Debugging and Troubleshooting** - Master the Playwright Inspector and Trace Viewer to debug any issue.

## Target Audience

This module is for learners who have a solid foundation in Playwright and TypeScript and are ready to transition into a senior automation role. It is ideal for those who will be responsible for designing and leading test automation efforts on a professional team.
