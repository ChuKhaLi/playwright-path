# Lesson 3.1: Advanced Playwright Features and APIs

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Utilize browser contexts for test isolation and parallel execution
- Implement network interception for request/response manipulation
- Configure mobile device emulation for responsive testing
- Apply advanced debugging and tracing capabilities
- Integrate performance monitoring into test workflows

## Duration

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours
- **Content Review**: 45 minutes
- **Hands-on Practice**: 90 minutes
- **Assessment**: 30 minutes

## Prerequisites

- Completion of MOD-E2E-01 (Basic Playwright fundamentals)
- Understanding of TypeScript classes and async/await
- Familiarity with browser developer tools
- Basic knowledge of HTTP requests and responses

## Lesson Overview

This lesson explores advanced Playwright capabilities that go beyond basic element interaction. You'll learn to leverage browser contexts for sophisticated test scenarios, intercept and modify network traffic, emulate mobile devices, and use advanced debugging tools. These features are essential for creating robust, professional-grade test automation.

## Key Concepts Covered

### 1. Browser Contexts and Isolation
- Understanding browser context vs. browser instance
- Creating and managing multiple contexts
- Context-specific configuration and state
- Parallel execution with context isolation

### 2. Network Interception and Manipulation
- Intercepting HTTP requests and responses
- Modifying request headers and payloads
- Mocking API responses for testing
- Monitoring network performance

### 3. Mobile Device Emulation
- Configuring viewport and device settings
- Touch interaction simulation
- Geolocation and device orientation
- Performance testing on mobile devices

### 4. Advanced Debugging and Tracing
- Using Playwright Inspector for step-by-step debugging
- Trace viewer for test execution analysis
- Screenshot and video capture strategies
- Performance profiling and metrics

### 5. Performance Monitoring Integration
- Measuring page load times and metrics
- Monitoring resource usage and optimization
- Identifying performance bottlenecks
- Creating performance-aware test assertions
