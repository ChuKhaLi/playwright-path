# Lesson 1: Advanced Locator Strategies and Patterns

## Overview

Welcome to the first lesson of the Advanced Playwright and Test Architecture module. This lesson focuses on advanced locator strategies, moving beyond basic selectors to build robust and resilient test automation scripts. Mastering locators is fundamental to creating stable tests that do not break with minor UI changes.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the limitations of basic selectors.
- Learn and apply Playwright's best practices for locators.
- Use chaining and filtering to create precise and flexible locators.
- Implement relative locators to find elements based on their relationship to other elements.
- Develop patterns for handling dynamic and complex web elements.

## Topics Covered

- The importance of robust locator strategies.
- Using built-in locators (`getByRole`, `getByText`, `getByLabel`, etc.).
- Chaining locators for precision.
- Filtering locators with `filter()`.
- Using relative locators like `rightOf()`, `leftOf()`, `above()`, and `below()`.
- Handling lists and dynamic elements.

## Prerequisites

- Completion of `MOD-E2E-01 Playwright E2E Fundamentals`.
- Solid understanding of TypeScript and basic Playwright concepts.
- Familiarity with HTML, CSS, and the DOM structure.
