# Lesson 12: Advanced Debugging and Troubleshooting

## Overview

Even in a well-architected framework, tests will fail. The ability to quickly and effectively debug failing tests is a critical skill for any automation engineer. This final lesson covers the advanced debugging tools and techniques Playwright provides to help you diagnose and fix issues efficiently.

## Learning Objectives

- Master the use of the Playwright Inspector for live debugging.
- Learn how to use the Trace Viewer for post-mortem analysis of failed tests.
- Understand how to effectively use browser developer tools within a Playwright test.
- Implement strategies for debugging flaky tests.
- Use Playwright's logging and verbose output to get more insights.

## Topics Covered

- Interactive debugging with the Playwright Inspector (`--debug` flag).
- Step-by-step execution and locator exploration.
- In-depth analysis with the Playwright Trace Viewer.
- Using `page.pause()` to halt execution and inspect the browser.
- Leveraging browser developer tools for complex issues.
- Strategies for identifying and fixing flaky tests (e.g., analyzing traces, adding assertions).

## Prerequisites

- Completion of all previous lessons in this module.
- A willingness to dive deep into failed test runs to find the root cause.
