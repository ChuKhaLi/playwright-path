# Lesson 5: Handling Complex UI Interactions

## Overview

Modern web applications are filled with rich, dynamic user interfaces that go beyond simple clicks and text input. This lesson covers how to automate complex UI interactions using Playwright's powerful APIs for actions like drag-and-drop, file uploads, hover, and handling iframes.

## Learning Objectives

- Automate drag-and-drop functionality.
- Handle file uploads and downloads.
- Interact with elements that require hovering.
- Work with iframes and nested frames.
- Handle custom keyboard shortcuts and mouse actions.

## Topics Covered

- `dragTo()` for drag-and-drop.
- `setInputFiles()` for file uploads.
- Handling file downloads and asserting their content.
- `hover()` to trigger hover-dependent UI.
- `frameLocator()` to interact with elements inside iframes.
- Advanced keyboard (`keyboard.press()`) and mouse (`mouse.dblclick()`) actions.

## Prerequisites

- Completion of `Lesson 4: Advanced Browser Context and Session Handling`.
- Familiarity with common web UI components.
