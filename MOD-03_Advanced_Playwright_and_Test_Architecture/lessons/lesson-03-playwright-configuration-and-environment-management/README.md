# Lesson 3: Playwright Configuration and Environment Management

## Overview

A robust test suite requires a flexible and powerful configuration system. This lesson dives deep into the `playwright.config.ts` file, exploring how to manage different test environments, configure project settings, and set up global parameters for your entire test suite.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the structure and key properties of the `playwright.config.ts` file.
- Learn how to define and use multiple projects for cross-browser and environment testing.
- Configure global settings like base URL, timeouts, and trace options.
- Use environment variables to manage sensitive data and environment-specific settings.
- Set up global setup and teardown scripts for tasks like database seeding or authentication.

## Topics Covered

- Anatomy of `playwright.config.ts`.
- Configuring `testDir`, `timeout`, and `expect`.
- Setting up `projects` for different browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit).
- Using a `baseURL` to simplify navigation.
- Managing different environments (e.g., `development`, `staging`, `production`).
- Storing and retrieving environment variables with `.env` files.
- Implementing `globalSetup` and `globalTeardown`.

## Prerequisites

- Completion of `Lesson 2: Page Object Model (POM) Design Patterns`.
- Basic familiarity with command-line interfaces and environment variables.
