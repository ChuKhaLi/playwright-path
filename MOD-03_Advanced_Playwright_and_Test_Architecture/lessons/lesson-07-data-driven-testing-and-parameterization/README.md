# Lesson 7: Data-Driven Testing and Parameterization

## Overview

Data-driven testing is a powerful technique where the same test logic is executed multiple times with different input data. This allows you to cover a wide range of scenarios with minimal code duplication. This lesson explores how to implement data-driven tests in Playwright using parameterization.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the concept and benefits of data-driven testing.
- Learn how to parameterize tests by running them in a loop.
- Use external data sources, like JSON or CSV files, to drive your tests.
- Create dynamic test titles for better reporting.
- Combine data-driven approaches with Page Object Models.

## Topics Covered

- The "why" of data-driven testing.
- Parameterizing tests with a simple `for` loop.
- Reading test data from a JSON file.
- Generating tests dynamically based on data.
- Best practices for managing test data.

## Prerequisites

- Completion of `Lesson 6: Playwright Test Fixtures and Hooks`.
- Basic knowledge of data formats like JSON.
