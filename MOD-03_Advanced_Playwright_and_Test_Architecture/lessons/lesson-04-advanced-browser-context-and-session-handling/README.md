# Lesson 4: Advanced Browser Context and Session Handling

## Overview

This lesson explores Playwright's concepts of Browser, BrowserContext, and Page, and how to leverage them for advanced testing scenarios. Understanding how to manage contexts and sessions is crucial for testing applications with complex user roles, permissions, and multi-user interactions.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the hierarchy: Browser -> BrowserContext -> Page.
- Learn how to create and use multiple browser contexts to simulate different users.
- Isolate test execution with fresh contexts for each test.
- Persist and reuse authentication state across tests to speed up execution.
- Manage cookies, local storage, and session storage within a context.

## Topics Covered

- The relationship between Browser, BrowserContext, and Page.
- Creating new browser contexts (`browser.newContext()`).
- Simulating multiple users in parallel.
- Reusing authentication state (`storageState`).
- Manipulating cookies and storage (`context.cookies()`, `context.addCookies()`).
- Setting permissions, geolocation, and other context-specific options.

## Prerequisites

- Completion of `Lesson 3: Playwright Configuration and Environment Management`.
- Understanding of web authentication concepts (cookies, tokens, etc.).
