# Lesson 07: API Performance and Load Testing

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Measure API response times with statistical analysis
- Test concurrent request handling and race condition scenarios
- Implement load testing patterns using Playwright's capabilities
- Detect performance regressions with baseline comparisons
- Optimize API test execution for speed and reliability

## üìö Lesson Overview

**Duration**: 4-6 hours  
**Type**: API Performance  
**Prerequisites**: Lesson 05 REST API Testing, basic performance concepts

This lesson focuses on API performance testing using Playwright, covering load testing, performance monitoring, and regression detection essential for production-ready APIs.
