# Lesson 06: API Schema Validation and Contract Testing ‚≠ê

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Implement JSON Schema validation using Ajv library integration
- Integrate OpenAPI/Swagger specifications for automated validation
- Apply contract testing patterns inspired by Pact methodology
- Validate API specification compliance with automated checks
- Handle schema evolution and breaking change detection

## üìö Lesson Overview

**Duration**: 5-7 hours  
**Type**: API Advanced (Priority Lesson)  
**Prerequisites**: Lesson 05 REST API Testing, JSON Schema basics

This is a **CRITICAL API TESTING LESSON** that elevates your testing from basic validation to professional contract testing. You'll master schema validation techniques used in enterprise API development.

## üéØ Why This Lesson is Essential

Contract testing and schema validation are:
- **Industry Standard**: Required in 95%+ of enterprise API projects
- **Quality Assurance**: Prevents breaking changes and API drift
- **Documentation**: Living documentation that stays in sync with code
- **Team Collaboration**: Enables frontend/backend team coordination
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated validation in deployment pipelines

## üîß Key Topics

### **1. JSON Schema Validation with Ajv**
- Schema definition and structure
- Data type validation and constraints
- Custom validation rules and formats
- Error handling and reporting
- Performance optimization

### **2. OpenAPI/Swagger Integration**
- Specification-driven testing
- Request/response validation
- Documentation compliance
- Code generation and tooling
- Version management

### **3. Contract Testing Patterns**
- Consumer-driven contracts
- Provider verification
- Contract evolution strategies
- Breaking change detection
- Cross-team collaboration

### **4. Advanced Validation Techniques**
- Nested schema validation
- Conditional validation rules
- Custom format validators
- Schema composition and inheritance
- Performance benchmarking
