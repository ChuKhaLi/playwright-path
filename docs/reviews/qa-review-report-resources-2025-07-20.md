## Detailed Findings by Category

### Critical Issues (0 found)
*No critical issues identified that would prevent system use.*

### High Priority Issues (2 found)

#### H1: Incomplete Quick-Reference Content
**File**: [`docs/resources/quick-reference/cheat-sheet.md`](../resources/quick-reference/cheat-sheet.md:4)  
**Issue**: Contains placeholder content instead of actual quick-reference information  
**Impact**: Reduces usability for learners seeking quick access to key information  
**Recommendation**: Complete the cheat sheet with actual content including:
- Top 10 most important resource links
- Time investment guide by learning path
- Mobile-friendly resource list
- No-registration-required resources

#### H2: Incomplete Resource Summary
**File**: [`docs/resources/quick-reference/resource-summary.md`](../resources/quick-reference/resource-summary.md:4)  
**Issue**: Contains placeholder content for learning path summaries  
**Impact**: Missing quick access to essential resources by learning path  
**Recommendation**: Populate with actual resource summaries for each learning path

### Medium Priority Issues (4 found)

#### M1: Module Mapping Inconsistencies
**Files**: Various specification files  
**Issue**: Some resources show different module mappings between master index and individual specifications  
**Example**: [`freecodecamp-javascript-testing.md`](../resources/specifications/02-educational-platforms/freecodecamp-javascript-testing.md:8) shows MOD-01, MOD-02 but could also support MOD-03  
**Recommendation**: Audit all module mappings for consistency and completeness

#### M2: Missing External Resource References
**File**: [`docs/resources/guides/module-mapping.md`](../resources/guides/module-mapping.md:30)  
**Issue**: References to external resources (MDN, The Odin Project) without corresponding specification files  
**Impact**: Incomplete resource catalog  
**Recommendation**: Create specification files for all referenced external resources or remove references

#### M3: Time Estimate Variations
**Files**: Multiple specification files  
**Issue**: Time estimates vary between master index and individual specifications  
**Impact**: Inconsistent planning information for learners  
**Recommendation**: Standardize time estimates across all documents

#### M4: Limited Windows-Specific Guidance
**Files**: Access guide and integration recommendations  
**Issue**: Limited explicit guidance for Windows users  
**Impact**: May create confusion for Windows-based learners  
**Recommendation**: Add Windows-specific sections where relevant

### Low Priority Issues (3 found)

#### L1: Passive Voice Usage
**Files**: Multiple documents  
**Issue**: Some sections use passive voice where active would be clearer  
**Example**: "Resources should be introduced" vs "Introduce resources"  
**Recommendation**: Convert to active voice where appropriate

#### L2: Technical Specification Gaps
**Files**: Various specification files  
**Issue**: Some technical specification sections contain "N/A" entries  
**Impact**: Reduced technical detail for advanced users  
**Recommendation**: Research and populate missing technical details

#### L3: Currency Granularity
**Files**: Resource specifications  
**Issue**: Currency status uses broad ranges (2024-2025) rather than specific dates  
**Impact**: Difficulty assessing exact resource freshness  
**Recommendation**: Use more specific currency indicators where possible
