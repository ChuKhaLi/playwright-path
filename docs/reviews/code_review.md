        // An automated test script for a login form
        test('should display an error message with invalid credentials', async ({ page }) => {
          await page.goto('https://example.com/login');
          await page.fill('#username', 'invalid-user');
          await page.fill('#password', 'invalid-password');
          await page.click('button[type="submit"]');
          await expect(page.locator('.error-message')).toBeVisible();
        });
        ```

A small section or a table comparing their features (e.g., interfaces are extendable, type aliases can represent unions and primitives) would be very helpful for learners.
2.  **`Record<string, any>`:** The lesson uses `Record<string, any>` in the `TestCase` type. It would be beneficial to explain what this utility type does and why it's used.
3.  **Code-Related Enhancements:**
    *   **Error Messages:** When showing code that would cause an error (e.g., modifying a `readonly` property), it would be helpful to include the actual TypeScript error message in a comment. This shows learners what to expect from the compiler.
        ```typescript
        // testUser.id = "different-id";  // Error: Cannot assign to 'id' because it is a read-only property.
        ```
    *   **Real-world API Response:** The `ApiResponse` example is good, but a more concrete example based on a real-world API (like a weather API or a social media API) could make the concept of handling dynamic properties even clearer.
