## Understanding the Architecture

### The 7-Module Framework

Each module follows a consistent structure designed for progressive learning:

| Module | Focus | Prerequisites | Duration | Key Deliverables |
|--------|-------|---------------|----------|------------------|
| MOD-01 | Web Foundations | None | 2-4 weeks | HTML/CSS/HTTP understanding |
| MOD-02 | TypeScript | MOD-01 | 3-5 weeks | TypeScript proficiency |
| MOD-03 | Playwright Basics | MOD-01, MOD-02 | 3-4 weeks | First automated tests |
| MOD-04 | Advanced Playwright | MOD-03 | 4-6 weeks | Complex test scenarios |
| MOD-05 | Test Architecture | MOD-04 | 3-5 weeks | Maintainable test suites |
| MOD-06 | CI/CD Integration | MOD-05 | 2-4 weeks | Automated pipelines |
| MOD-07 | Specialization | MOD-06 | 3-6 weeks | Advanced testing techniques |

### Learning Path Integration

Content must support 4 different learning paths:

**Path A: Complete Beginner**
- Extensive foundational content
- Step-by-step explanations
- Multiple practice opportunities
- Frequent knowledge checks

**Path B: Programming Background**
- Accelerated programming concepts
- Focus on testing-specific skills
- Comparative examples with other languages
- Advanced exercises earlier

**Path C: Testing Experience**
- Bridge manual to automated testing
- Tool-specific focus
- Real-world scenario emphasis
- Quick practical application

**Path D: Advanced Practitioner**
- Specialized techniques
- Best practices and patterns
- Industry case studies
- Cutting-edge features

## Content Creation Workflow

### Phase 1: Planning and Research

1. **Review Module Specifications**
   - Read [`docs/memory-bank/modules/MOD-XX_Name/module_spec.md`](docs/memory-bank/modules/)
   - Understand learning objectives
   - Identify prerequisite knowledge
   - Review resource mappings

2. **Analyze Target Resources**
   - Study assigned resources from [`docs/resources/module-mapping.md`](docs/resources/module-mapping.md)
   - Identify key concepts and examples
   - Plan integration points
   - Note any gaps or overlaps

3. **Define Learning Outcomes**
   - Create measurable objectives
   - Design assessment criteria
   - Plan milestone checkpoints
   - Align with overall roadmap

### Phase 2: Content Development

#### Lesson Structure Template

```markdown

```

#### Code Example Standards

**TypeScript Best Practices:**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Well-commented, typed code
interface LoginCredentials {
  username: string;
  password: string;
}

async function loginUser(page: Page, credentials: LoginCredentials): Promise<void> {
  // Navigate to login page
  await page.goto('/login');
  
  // Fill login form with provided credentials
  await page.fill('[data-testid="username"]', credentials.username);
  await page.fill('[data-testid="password"]', credentials.password);
  
  // Submit form and wait for navigation
  await page.click('[data-testid="login-button"]');
  await page.waitForURL('/dashboard');
}
```

**Playwright Best Practices:**
- Use web-first assertions: `expect(locator).toBeVisible()`
- Prefer data-testid over CSS selectors
- Include proper error handling
- Demonstrate async/await patterns
- Show debugging techniques

### Phase 3: Resource Integration

#### Primary Integration Methods

1. **Direct Reference**
   ```markdown
   üìñ **Read**: [Playwright Locators Guide](https://playwright.dev/docs/locators)
   
   Focus on sections 1-3 covering basic locator strategies.
   ```

2. **Guided Exploration**
   ```markdown
   üéØ **Explore**: Complete the interactive tutorial at [Try Playwright](https://try.playwright.dev/)
   
   **Your Mission**: 
   - Complete exercises 1-5
   - Pay special attention to the locator examples
   - Note any questions for discussion
   ```

3. **Comparative Analysis**
   ```markdown
   üîç **Compare**: Review both approaches:
   - [Official Playwright Docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions)
   - [Community Best Practices](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/discussions)
   
   **Discussion Points**: Which approach works better for your use case?
   ```

#### Integration Timing

- **Pre-Learning**: Background reading before lesson
- **During Learning**: Reference materials during explanation
- **Post-Learning**: Additional depth and practice
- **Assessment**: Resource-based evaluation questions

## Resource Integration Best Practices

### Pedagogical Strategies

#### 1. Scaffolded Learning
- Start with simpler resources
- Build complexity gradually
- Provide clear connections between resources
- Offer multiple perspectives on key concepts

#### 2. Active Learning Integration
```markdown
