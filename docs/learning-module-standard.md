# Learning Module Standard for QA Automation Roadmap

**Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-30  
**Status**: Active  

## üìö Document Overview

This document defines the comprehensive standard for creating, organizing, and maintaining learning modules within the QA Automation Roadmap project. It ensures consistency, quality, and effective integration across all educational content while supporting our core educational philosophy of beginner-first, progressive learning, and practical application.

## üéØ Educational Philosophy Alignment

All modules must adhere to our core educational principles:

- **Beginner-First**: Assume zero prior knowledge and explain concepts in simplest terms
- **Progressive Learning**: Logical sequence where each topic builds upon previous knowledge
- **Context is Key**: Always explain why concepts matter and how they fit the bigger picture
- **Practicality Over Theory**: Focus on real-world application with immediate practical value
