# Project Specification

## 1. Project Vision

To build a comprehensive, AI-driven educational platform for learning QA automation with Playwright and TypeScript. The platform will leverage a suite of specialized AI modes to provide a dynamic and interactive learning experience, from generating course content to creating hands-on exercises and providing targeted feedback.

## 2. Core Modules

The platform is built around a series of interconnected educational modules that cover the full spectrum of QA automation, organized into three specialized learning paths.

### Foundation Modules
| Module ID | Module Name | Description |
|---|---|---|
| MOD-01 | Foundations of Web Technologies | Introduces core concepts of web technologies, including HTML, CSS, HTTP, and API fundamentals. |
| MOD-02 | TypeScript for Automation | A deep dive into TypeScript for writing robust and maintainable test code. |

### E2E Testing Path
| Module ID | Module Name | Description |
|---|---|---|
| MOD-E2E-01 | Playwright E2E Fundamentals | Covers setting up Playwright, basic commands, and core E2E testing concepts. |
| MOD-E2E-02 | Advanced E2E Testing Techniques | Dives into advanced E2E topics like authentication, network interception, and file handling. |
| MOD-E2E-03 | E2E Test Architecture and Design | Teaches best practices for structuring E2E test suites, including the Page Object Model (POM). |

### API Testing Path
| Module ID | Module Name | Description |
|---|---|---|
| MOD-API-01 | API Testing Fundamentals with Playwright | Comprehensive introduction to API testing using Playwright's request fixture. |
| MOD-API-02 | Advanced API Testing Strategies | Advanced API testing techniques including authentication, performance, and integration testing. |
| MOD-API-03 | API Test Architecture and Contracts | API client architecture patterns, schema validation, and contract testing. |

### Advanced Specialization Path
| Module ID | Module Name | Description |
|---|---|---|
| MOD-ADV-01 | CI/CD and DevOps Integration | Explains how to integrate automated tests into CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and Docker. |
| MOD-ADV-02 | Specialized Testing Topics | Explores specialized areas like visual, performance, accessibility, and security testing. |

## 3. Technical Architecture

The system is designed with a modular architecture to ensure scalability and maintainability.

- **Frontend:** Not yet defined. The initial focus is on the backend and content generation capabilities.
- **Backend:** The core logic is managed by Roo, an AI agent with access to a filesystem and a suite of specialized modes.
- **AI Modes:** 8 specialized AI modes (`.roomodes`) are responsible for content creation, an educational framework, and more.
- **Rule System:** A hierarchical rule system (`.roo/rules/`) governs the behavior of the AI, ensuring consistency and adherence to educational standards.
- **Memory Bank:** A persistent storage system (`docs/memory-bank/global/`) that provides context to the AI about the project's state, specifications, and history.
- **Language:** TypeScript is the primary language for all code examples and test scripts.
