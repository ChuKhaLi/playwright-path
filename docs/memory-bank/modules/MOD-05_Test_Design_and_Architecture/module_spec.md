# Module Specification: MOD-05 Test Design and Architecture

This document outlines the technical specifications for this module.

## 1. Overview
This module focuses on the principles of good test design and architecture. Learners will learn how to structure their test suites in a way that is scalable, maintainable, and easy to understand.

## 2. Scope
- **Page Object Model (POM):** A deep dive into this essential design pattern.
- **Test Data Management:** Strategies for managing test data, including data-driven testing.
- **Reporting:** Customizing HTML reports and integrating with third-party reporting tools.
- **Best Practices:** A comprehensive review of the official Playwright best practices.
- **Code Reusability:** Creating custom helper functions and utility classes.

## 3. Learning Objectives
- By the end of this module, learners will be able to:
  - Implement the Page Object Model in a Playwright project.
  - Design and implement a robust test data management strategy.
  - Create a scalable and maintainable test framework from scratch.
  - Apply industry best practices to their test automation code.

## 4. Prerequisites
- `MOD-04: Advanced Playwright Techniques`

## 5. Recommended Resources
- **Playwright Best Practices Guide:** The primary reference for this module.
- **Test Automation Patterns:** For a deeper understanding of design patterns.
- **Playwright Demo Repository:** For examples of well-structured projects.
- **Jest/Vitest Documentation:** For test organization and structure.

## 6. Hands-on Exercises
- A series of exercises to refactor a messy test suite into a well-structured one using POM.
- A final project to design and build a complete test framework for a complex application.

## 7. Assessment Methods
- Quizzes on design patterns and best practices.
- A practical assessment where learners design and build a test framework for a given application.

## 8. Dependencies
- `MOD-04: Advanced Playwright Techniques`
