## Module Overview
**Module ID**: MOD-03  
**Module Name**: Advanced Playwright and Test Architecture  
**Module Status**: ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT - CONTENT CREATION PHASE  
**Priority Level**: HIGH PRIORITY - Core curriculum module  
**Target Completion**: 2025-08-15  
**Current Progress**: 15% Complete (Memory bank created, directory structure exists)

## Development Status

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- [x] **Memory Bank Creation**: Module specification, learning objectives, and state tracking
- [x] **Directory Structure**: All 12 lesson directories created with proper naming
- [x] **Curriculum Integration**: Aligned with Enhanced Balanced Roadmap (67% E2E, 17% API, 16% Hybrid)
- [x] **Resource Mapping**: Connected to 8 primary resources from docs/resources/ system

### Phase 2: Content Development üèóÔ∏è IN PROGRESS
**Current Status**: 0% Complete (Ready to begin lesson content creation)

#### High Priority Lessons (Foundation) - 0% Complete
- [ ] **Lesson 01: Advanced Playwright Features and APIs** - NEXT TARGET
  - **Status**: üèóÔ∏è STRUCTURE CREATED - **HIGH PRIORITY**
  - **Priority**: Foundation lesson - critical for module success
  - **Components Needed**: content.md, examples/ (3 files), exercises/ (2 files), assessment.md
  - **Complexity**: 30% Foundation level
  - **Dependencies**: None (can start immediately)

- [ ] **Lesson 02: Page Object Model (POM) Design Pattern** - SECOND PRIORITY
  - **Status**: üèóÔ∏è STRUCTURE CREATED - **HIGH PRIORITY**  
  - **Priority**: Core architectural pattern - essential concept
  - **Components Needed**: content.md, examples/ (3 files), exercises/ (2 files), assessment.md
  - **Complexity**: 30% Foundation level
  - **Dependencies**: Lesson 01 concepts (fixtures, contexts)

## Content Creation Strategy

### Immediate Action Plan
1. **Start with Lesson 01**: Advanced Playwright Features and APIs
   - Create comprehensive content.md following Learning Module Standard
   - Build working examples demonstrating advanced fixtures, contexts, and configuration
   - Design progressive exercises building from basic to advanced implementation
   - Create assessment with SMART learning objectives validation

2. **Follow with Lesson 02**: Page Object Model Design Pattern
   - Strong architectural foundation before implementation
   - Critical for all subsequent lessons that use POM patterns
   - Essential for professional test automation practices

## Technical Specifications

### Code Standards
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict typing
- **Framework**: Playwright v1.45+
- **Platform**: Windows-compatible syntax throughout
- **Documentation**: JSDoc comments for all functions and classes
- **Testing**: Working examples that can be executed independently

### Learning Progression
- **Foundation ‚Üí Core ‚Üí Advanced**: 30% ‚Üí 40% ‚Üí 30% complexity distribution
- **Hands-On First**: Practical implementation before theoretical deep-dives
- **Progressive Complexity**: Each lesson builds incrementally on previous concepts
- **Professional Focus**: Enterprise-grade patterns and practices

## Success Metrics

### Development Milestones
- **Week 1**: Lessons 01-02 complete (Foundation phase)
- **Week 2**: Lessons 03-06 complete (Core implementation)
- **Week 3**: Lessons 07-09 complete (Specialized techniques)
- **Week 4**: Lessons 10-12 complete (Architecture and synthesis)

### Quality Indicators
- **Technical Accuracy**: All code examples execute successfully
- **Educational Effectiveness**: Learning objectives measurably achieved
- **Professional Relevance**: Skills directly applicable to senior QA roles
- **Student Engagement**: High completion rates and positive feedback
