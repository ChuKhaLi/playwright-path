# Learning Objectives: MOD-05 Advanced Playwright and Test Architecture

## ðŸ“‹ Module Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this module, learners will be able to design, implement, and maintain robust, scalable, and maintainable test automation frameworks using advanced Playwright features and established architectural patterns. This module bridges the gap between writing individual tests and engineering a comprehensive testing solution.

## ðŸŽ¯ Primary Learning Objectives

### 1. Advanced Playwright Techniques (Apply & Analyze)

**LO-5.1: Advanced Locator Strategies**
- Implement Playwright's advanced locator features, including filtering, chaining, and layout-based locators.
- Analyze complex web applications to devise resilient and efficient locator strategies.
- Evaluate the trade-offs between different locator types for long-term maintainability.

**LO-5.2: Mastering Browser Contexts and Authentication**
- Apply different strategies for handling authentication, including session storage and API-based login.
- Isolate tests effectively using browser contexts to manage state and parallelism.
- Analyze test scenarios to determine the optimal use of browser contexts for speed and reliability.

**LO-5.3: Data-Driven Testing**
- Implement data-driven tests in Playwright using various data sources (e.g., JSON, CSV).
- Design test data structures that are reusable and easy to maintain.
- Apply parameterization techniques to increase test coverage with minimal code duplication.

### 2. Test Architecture and Design Patterns (Create & Evaluate)

**LO-5.4: Page Object Model (POM) Mastery**
- Create a scalable and maintainable test framework using the Page Object Model.
- Evaluate and refactor an existing test suite to implement the POM pattern effectively.
- Design base page and component objects to maximize code reuse and reduce maintenance overhead.

**LO-5.5: Test Fixtures and Hooks**
- Create custom Playwright test fixtures to manage test setup, teardown, and data injection.
- Analyze test suites to identify opportunities for simplification using fixtures.
- Implement global setup and teardown logic for efficient test execution.

**LO-5.6: Framework Design**
- Design a test automation framework from scratch, considering scalability, maintainability, and reporting.
- Evaluate different framework design patterns and select the most appropriate one for a given project.
- Create a configuration management system for the framework to handle different test environments.

## ðŸ”§ Practical Application Objectives

### Framework Implementation
**LO-5.7: Building a Test Framework**
- Build a complete, multi-layered test automation framework incorporating POM, fixtures, and data-driven testing.
- Integrate the framework with a sample application, covering key user flows.
- Implement a robust reporting and logging mechanism within the framework.

### Advanced Problem Solving
**LO-5.8: Handling Complex Scenarios**
- Apply advanced techniques to handle complex UI interactions like drag-and-drop, file uploads, and iframes.
- Create solutions for testing applications with dynamic content and frequent UI changes.
- Debug and troubleshoot complex test failures within the framework architecture.

## ðŸ“Š Assessment Alignment

### Knowledge Assessment (LO-5.1, LO-5.2)
- **Code Reviews**: Analyze and critique different implementations of locator strategies and authentication handling.
- **Quizzes**: Questions on advanced Playwright APIs and their use cases.

### Application Assessment (LO-5.3, LO-5.4, LO-5.5)
- **Coding Exercises**: Refactor a "flat" test script into a well-structured POM framework.
- **Practical Labs**: Implement custom fixtures to solve a given test setup problem.

### Synthesis Assessment (LO-5.6, LO-5.7, LO-5.8)
- **Capstone Project**: Design and build a test automation framework for a complex web application from the ground up.
- **Architectural Review**: Present and defend the design choices made in the capstone project.
- **Portfolio Piece**: The completed framework will serve as a significant portfolio item demonstrating advanced competency.

## ðŸŽ“ Competency Levels

### Intermediate Level (Lessons 1-5)
- **Pattern Application**: Can correctly implement POM and basic fixtures in a given project.
- **Advanced Tooling**: Comfortably uses advanced Playwright features to solve common problems.

### Advanced Level (Lessons 6-12)
- **Framework Design**: Can design a test framework architecture for a new project.
- **Strategic Abstraction**: Knows what, when, and how to abstract parts of the framework for reusability.

### Expert Level (Post-Module)
- **Architectural Leadership**: Can lead the design and implementation of a testing strategy for a large-scale enterprise application.
- **Innovation**: Develops novel patterns and custom tooling to solve unique testing challenges.

## ðŸ“ˆ Success Criteria

### Minimum Competency Standards
- **Framework Construction**: Can build a functional test framework using POM and fixtures.
- **Code Quality**: Writes clean, readable, and maintainable test automation code.
