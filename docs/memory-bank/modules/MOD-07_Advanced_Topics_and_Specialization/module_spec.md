# Module Specification: MOD-07 Advanced Topics and Specialization

This document outlines the technical specifications for this module.

## 1. Overview
This module allows learners to explore specialized areas of testing with Playwright. It is designed for those who have mastered the core concepts and want to develop expertise in high-demand areas.

## 2. Scope
This module is divided into several specialization tracks. Learners can choose one or more to focus on.

- **Visual Regression Testing:** Using Playwright's screenshot capabilities and integrating with tools like Applitools or Percy.
- **Performance Testing:** Using Playwright to gather performance metrics and integrating with tools like Lighthouse.
- **Accessibility Testing:** Integrating with tools like Axe to automate accessibility checks.
- **Component Testing:** Using Playwright's experimental component testing features.
- **Security Testing:** An introduction to how Playwright can be used to automate basic security checks (e.g., checking for common vulnerabilities).

## 3. Learning Objectives
- By the end of this module, learners will be able to:
  - Implement a visual regression testing strategy.
  - Automate performance checks within their test suite.
  - Integrate accessibility testing into their CI/CD pipeline.
  - Understand and implement component tests.
  - Perform basic security checks with Playwright.

## 4. Prerequisites
