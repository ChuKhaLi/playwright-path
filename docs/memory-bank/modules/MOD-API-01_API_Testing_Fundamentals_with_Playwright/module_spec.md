# MOD-API-01: API Testing Fundamentals with Playwright - Module Specification

## Module Overview

**Module ID**: MOD-API-01  
**Module Name**: API Testing Fundamentals with Playwright  
**Module Type**: API Testing Foundation  
**Estimated Duration**: 4-6 weeks  
**Difficulty Level**: Beginner to Intermediate  

## Module Description

This module provides comprehensive foundational knowledge for API testing using Playwright. It covers HTTP fundamentals, REST API concepts, and practical implementation of API tests using Playwright's request fixture. The module is designed for manual testers transitioning to API automation and developers new to API testing.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, learners will be able to:

1. **Understand HTTP Protocol**: Master HTTP methods, status codes, headers, and request/response structure
2. **Comprehend REST API Principles**: Understand RESTful design, resource modeling, and API contracts
3. **Implement API Tests with Playwright**: Use Playwright's request fixture for comprehensive API testing
4. **Design Test Scenarios**: Create effective test cases for various API endpoints and operations
5. **Validate API Responses**: Implement robust response validation including status codes, headers, and body content
6. **Handle Authentication**: Test APIs with various authentication mechanisms
7. **Manage Test Data**: Implement effective test data strategies for API testing
8. **Debug API Issues**: Use tools and techniques to troubleshoot API test failures
