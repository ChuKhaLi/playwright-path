# Learning Objectives: MOD-01 Foundations of QA Automation

## ðŸ“‹ Module Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this module, learners will possess a solid understanding of the fundamental concepts of quality assurance, software testing, and the core web technologies that underpin modern web applications. This module serves as the essential groundwork for a career in QA automation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Primary Learning Objectives

### 1. QA and Testing Fundamentals (Remember & Understand)

**LO-1.1: Core Concepts**
- Define Quality Assurance (QA) and its role in the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
- Differentiate between manual and automated testing, and articulate the benefits and drawbacks of each.
- Explain fundamental testing types (e.g., unit, integration, system, acceptance).
- Describe the purpose of a test plan and a test case.

**LO-1.2: Web Technologies**
- Identify and describe the roles of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a web application.
- Explain the structure of an HTML document and the purpose of the Document Object Model (DOM).
- Understand the client-server model and the basics of the HTTP protocol.
- Define what an API is and its function in web applications.

### 2. Essential Technical Skills (Apply & Analyze)

**LO-1.3: HTML and CSS for Testers**
- Analyze the structure of a web page using browser developer tools.
- Construct basic CSS selectors to identify web elements for testing.
- Write simple XPath expressions to locate elements that are not easily accessible via CSS.
- Evaluate the accessibility of a web page based on its HTML structure.

**LO-1.4: JavaScript and APIs for Testers**
- Read and understand simple JavaScript code to comprehend basic application logic.
- Use browser developer tools to inspect network requests and analyze API responses.
- Interpret JSON data structures commonly found in API responses.
- Apply basic debugging techniques using the browser console.

### 3. Introduction to Automation (Apply & Analyze)

**LO-1.5: Automation Concepts**
- Identify the characteristics of a good test case for automation.
- Analyze a web application to identify key user flows suitable for E2E testing.
- Set up a basic development environment for test automation (Node.js, IDE).
- Explain the purpose of a test automation framework like Playwright.

## ðŸ”§ Practical Application Objectives

### Web Application Analysis
**LO-1.6: Element Location Mastery**
- Systematically use browser developer tools to inspect and identify unique and robust locators for web elements.
- Compare and contrast different locator strategies (ID, class, tag, attributes) and choose the most effective one for a given scenario.
- Formulate complex CSS selectors and XPath expressions to handle dynamic or nested elements.

### Foundational Automation Skills
**LO-1.7: Environment Setup and Tooling**
- Independently install and configure all necessary tools for a Playwright project.
- Write and execute a basic "hello world" test script using Playwright.
- Understand and navigate the file structure of a basic Playwright project.

## ðŸ“Š Assessment Alignment

### Knowledge Assessment (LO-1.1, LO-1.2)
- **Quizzes**: Multiple choice and short answer questions on QA terminology and web concepts.
- **Concept Mapping**: Create diagrams explaining the relationships between different testing types.

### Application Assessment (LO-1.3, LO-1.4, LO-1.5)
- **Practical Labs**: Use developer tools to find specific elements on a live website.
- **Coding Exercises**: Write CSS selectors and XPath expressions for given HTML structures.
- **Setup Task**: Successfully set up a complete local development environment.

### Synthesis Assessment (LO-1.6, LO-1.7)
- **Mini-Project**: Create a simple test plan for a small feature and identify locators for all interactive elements.
- **Peer Review**: Evaluate the quality of locators chosen by a peer.

## ðŸŽ“ Competency Levels

### Beginner Level (Lessons 1-8)
- **Basic Recall**: Define key terms and concepts.
- **Guided Application**: Follow tutorials to use browser developer tools.

### Intermediate Level (Lessons 9-16)
- **Independent Application**: Write selectors and analyze web pages without guidance.
- **Problem Solving**: Debug simple issues with locators or environment setup.

### Advanced Level (Lessons 17-24)
- **Strategic Thinking**: Choose the best locator strategy for complex scenarios.
- **Synthesis**: Combine knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JS to understand how a web page functions as a whole.

## ðŸ“ˆ Success Criteria

### Minimum Competency Standards
- **Conceptual Fluency**: Can explain all fundamental concepts in their own words.
- **Practical Skill**: Can reliably find a robust locator for any element on a given web page.
- **Tool Proficiency**: Can comfortably use browser developer tools for inspection and basic debugging.

### Excellence Indicators
- **Efficiency**: Quickly identifies the most resilient locator for an element.
- **Proactive Learning**: Independently researches web technologies to better understand application behavior.
- **Teaching**: Can explain foundational concepts clearly to a non-technical person.
