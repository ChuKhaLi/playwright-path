# Module Specification: MOD-06 CI/CD and DevOps Integration

This document outlines the technical specifications for this module.

## 1. Overview
This module covers the critical final step in the automation lifecycle: integrating tests into a CI/CD pipeline. Learners will understand how to run their tests automatically, report results, and contribute to a DevOps culture.

## 2. Scope
- **GitHub Actions:** A deep dive into creating workflows for Playwright.
- **Docker:** Running tests in a containerized environment for consistency.
- **Parallel Execution:** Strategies for running tests in parallel to reduce execution time.
- **Reporting Dashboards:** Integrating with third-party tools to visualize test results over time.
- **Notifications:** Setting up notifications for test failures (e.g., via Slack or email).

## 3. Learning Objectives
- By the end of this module, learners will be able to:
  - Create a GitHub Actions workflow to run Playwright tests on every code change.
  - Run tests within a Docker container.
  - Configure and optimize parallel test execution.
  - Set up a reporting dashboard to track test results.
  - Integrate test failure notifications into a team's workflow.

## 4. Prerequisites
- `MOD-05: Test Design and Architecture`

## 5. Recommended Resources
- **GitHub Actions Documentation:** The primary reference for this module.
- **Playwright Official Documentation:** The "CI/CD" and "Docker" sections.
- **Official Playwright YouTube Channel:** For demos on CI/CD integration.
- **Awesome Playwright:** For community tools and examples related to CI/CD.

## 6. Hands-on Exercises
- A series of exercises to build a complete CI/CD pipeline for a sample project.
- A final project to integrate the test framework built in MOD-05 into a full CI/CD workflow.

## 7. Assessment Methods
- Quizzes on CI/CD concepts and GitHub Actions syntax.
- A practical assessment where learners set up a complete CI/CD pipeline for a given project.

## 8. Dependencies
- `MOD-05: Test Design and Architecture`
