# Module Specification: MOD-03 Playwright Fundamentals

This document outlines the technical specifications for this module.

## 1. Overview
This module introduces learners to the core concepts of Playwright. It covers everything from installation to writing and running first tests, with a strong emphasis on best practices from the start.

## 2. Scope
- **Installation and Setup:** Setting up a new Playwright project with TypeScript.
- **Configuration:** Understanding the `playwright.config.ts` file.
- **Core Concepts:** Browsers, contexts, and pages.

- **Assertions:** Using web-first assertions with `expect`.
- **Trace Viewer:** A detailed look at this powerful debugging tool.

## 3. Learning Objectives
- By the end of this module, learners will be able to:
  - Set up a Playwright project from scratch.
  - Write basic tests that perform common user interactions.
  - Use locators effectively to create stable tests.
  - Use the Trace Viewer to debug and analyze test runs.
