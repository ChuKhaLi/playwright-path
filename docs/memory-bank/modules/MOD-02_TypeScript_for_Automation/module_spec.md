# Module Specification: MOD-02 TypeScript for Automation

This document outlines the technical specifications for this module.

## 1. Overview
This module provides a deep dive into TypeScript, focusing on the features most relevant to test automation. It is designed to equip learners with the skills to write robust, maintainable, and type-safe test code.

## 2. Scope
- **TypeScript Basics:** Variables, functions, and basic types.
- **Advanced Types:** Union types, intersection types, and generics.
- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Classes, interfaces, and inheritance.
- **Modules:** Importing and exporting modules.
- **Configuration:** A detailed look at `tsconfig.json` and its options.
- **Async/Await:** Handling asynchronous operations, which is critical for Playwright.

## 3. Learning Objectives
- By the end of this module, learners will be able to:
  - Write clean and maintainable TypeScript code.
  - Use advanced types to create flexible and robust test frameworks.
  - Structure code using classes and modules.
  - Configure the TypeScript compiler for a test automation project.
  - Comfortably work with asynchronous code.

## 4. Prerequisites
- `MOD-01: Foundations of Web Technologies`

## 5. Recommended Resources
- **TypeScript Handbook:** The primary reference for this module.
- **TypeScript Course - Programming with Mosh:** For a comprehensive video-based introduction.
- **freeCodeCamp - JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures:** For practicing programming fundamentals.

## 6. Hands-on Exercises
- A series of coding challenges to practice TypeScript features.
- A final project to build a small, typed utility library for testing.

## 7. Assessment Methods
- Quizzes on TypeScript syntax and features.
- A practical assessment where learners refactor a JavaScript project into TypeScript.

## 8. Dependencies
- `MOD-01: Foundations of Web Technologies`
