# Security Best Practices for QA Automation

This guide outlines the best practices for handling sensitive data within the QA automation codebase. Following these guidelines is crucial to prevent security vulnerabilities.

## 1. Never Hardcode Credentials

Hardcoding credentials, such as passwords, API keys, or secret tokens, is a significant security risk. These values should never be stored directly in the source code.

**Bad Practice:**

```typescript
const password = 'MySecretPassword123!';
```

## 2. Use Environment Variables

The recommended approach for managing sensitive data is to use environment variables. This allows you to keep your credentials separate from the codebase and configure them securely in different environments (e.g., local, CI/CD).

**Good Practice:**

```typescript
// Use process.env to access environment variables
const password = process.env.USER_PASSWORD;
```

### Local Development

For local development, you can use a `.env` file to store your environment variables. Make sure to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being committed to the repository.

**.env file:**

```
USER_PASSWORD=MySecretPassword123!
API_KEY=abcdef123456
```

**.gitignore file:**

```
# Ignore environment variables
.env
```

## 3. Use Secure Vaults for CI/CD

In a CI/CD environment, use the secret management features of your CI/CD provider (e.g., GitHub Secrets, GitLab CI/CD variables, AWS Secrets Manager). These services provide a secure way to store and access your credentials during the pipeline execution.

## 4. Placeholder for Example Code

When writing example code, use placeholders to indicate where a credential should be used. This makes it clear that a value needs to be provided without exposing any sensitive information.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "username": "testuser",
  "password": "env:TEST_USER_PASSWORD"
}
```

By following these best practices, you can ensure that the QA automation codebase remains secure and that sensitive data is handled correctly.
