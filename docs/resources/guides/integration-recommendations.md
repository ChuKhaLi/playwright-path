# Resource Integration Recommendations

This document provides detailed recommendations for integrating curated resources into the learning-playwright project modules, including pedagogical strategies, timing, and implementation approaches.

For a complete overview, refer to the [Master Resource Index](../master-resource-index.md). For quick access information, see the [Access Guide](./access-guide.md).

## üéØ Integration Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Progressive Complexity**: Resources should be introduced in order of increasing difficulty
2. **Multi-Modal Learning**: Combine text, video, and hands-on practice for optimal retention
3. **Just-in-Time Learning**: Introduce resources when learners need them most
4. **Reinforcement Cycles**: Use multiple resources to reinforce key concepts
5. **Practical Application**: Every theoretical resource should be paired with practical exercises

### Integration Patterns
- **Foundation ‚Üí Practice ‚Üí Reinforcement**: Establish concepts, apply them, then deepen understanding
- **Reference ‚Üí Tutorial ‚Üí Project**: Use documentation as reference while following tutorials and building projects
- **Community ‚Üí Official ‚Üí Advanced**: Start with community insights, validate with official sources, explore advanced topics
