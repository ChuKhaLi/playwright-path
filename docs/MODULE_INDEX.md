    -   Develop a portfolio-worthy project that showcases your skills.
    -   Learn how to build your resume, prepare for interviews, and navigate the QA job market.
    -   Understand career paths and opportunities in QA automation.

### [MOD-06: Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with Cucumber](./../MOD-06_Behavior_Driven_Development_BDD_with_Cucumber/)

-   **Description**: Learn how to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical team members using BDD. This module teaches you how to write tests in a human-readable format using Cucumber and Gherkin.
-   **Learning Objectives**:
    -   Understand the principles of BDD and its benefits.
    -   Write feature files using Gherkin syntax (Given, When, Then).
    -   Implement step definitions in TypeScript to connect your features to your Playwright code.
    -   Integrate BDD into your existing test framework.
