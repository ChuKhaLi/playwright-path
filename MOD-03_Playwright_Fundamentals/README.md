# MOD-03: Playwright Fundamentals

## 🎭 Module Overview

This module introduces learners to the core concepts of Playwright with a balanced approach to both E2E and API testing. It covers everything from installation to writing comprehensive tests, with emphasis on best practices from the start.

## 📚 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, learners will be able to:

- Set up a Playwright project from scratch with TypeScript configuration
- Write basic E2E tests that perform common user interactions
- Use Playwright's request fixture for API testing
- Master locator strategies for stable and maintainable tests
- Implement both E2E and API assertions effectively
- Use debugging tools like Trace Viewer for test analysis
- Combine API and E2E testing approaches in integrated workflows
- Organize tests with proper structure and best practices
