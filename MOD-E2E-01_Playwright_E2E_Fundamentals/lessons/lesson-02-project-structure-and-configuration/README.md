# Lesson 02: Project Structure and Configuration

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- **LO-13**: Set up a new Playwright project with TypeScript configuration from scratch
- **LO-14**: Configure [`playwright.config.ts`](playwright.config.ts:1) for different testing environments
- **LO-15**: Organize project structure following best practices
- **LO-16**: Manage environment-specific settings and variables
- **LO-17**: Configure test directories for both E2E and API testing
- **LO-18**: Set up proper TypeScript configuration for testing

## 📚 Lesson Overview

**Duration**: 1-2 hours  
**Type**: Foundation  
**Prerequisites**: Lesson 01 (Playwright Installation and Setup)
