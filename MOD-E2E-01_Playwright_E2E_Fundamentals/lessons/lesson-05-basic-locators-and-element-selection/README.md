3. **Apply CSS and XPath Selectors**
   - Create effective CSS selectors using [`page.locator()`](../../../page.locator())
   - Understand when and how to use XPath selectors
   - Combine multiple selector strategies for robust element targeting

4. **Implement Best Practices**
   - Choose the most appropriate locator strategy for different scenarios
   - Create maintainable and readable selectors
   - Avoid common pitfalls in element selection

5. **Handle Dynamic Content**
   - Work with elements that have changing attributes
   - Use partial matching and regular expressions
   - Handle elements in dynamic lists and tables

6. **Debug Locator Issues**
   - Use Playwright's debugging tools to test locators

## Key Concepts

### Built-in Locators (Recommended)
- **`getByRole()`**: Semantic element selection based on ARIA roles
- **`getByText()`**: Content-based selection using visible text
- **`getByLabel()`**: Form element selection using associated labels
- **`getByPlaceholder()`**: Input element selection using placeholder text
- **`getByTitle()`**: Element selection using title attributes
- **`getByTestId()`**: Selection using dedicated test identifiers

### CSS Selectors
- **Element selectors**: `div`, `input`, `button`
- **Class selectors**: `.class-name`, `.multiple.classes`
- **ID selectors**: `#unique-id`
- **Attribute selectors**: `[data-testid="value"]`, `[type="submit"]`
- **Pseudo-selectors**: `:nth-child()`, `:first-of-type`, `:visible`

### XPath Selectors
- **Absolute paths**: `/html/body/div[1]/form`
- **Relative paths**: `//button[@type="submit"]`
- **Text-based selection**: `//span[contains(text(), "Submit")]`
- **Complex conditions**: `//div[@class="form-group" and @data-required="true"]`

### Locator Strategies
1. **Prefer built-in locators** for better readability and maintainability
2. **Use semantic selectors** that reflect user interaction patterns
3. **Avoid brittle selectors** that depend on implementation details
4. **Combine strategies** for robust element targeting
5. **Test across browsers** to ensure consistency
