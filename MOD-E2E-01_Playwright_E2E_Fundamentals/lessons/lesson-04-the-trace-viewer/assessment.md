# Assessment: The Trace Viewer

## Instructions

This assessment tests your understanding of the Playwright Trace Viewer and its debugging capabilities. Choose the best answer for each question. Each question is worth equal points, and you need 75% or higher to pass.

## Question 1: Trace Configuration

**Which trace mode would be most appropriate for a CI/CD pipeline where you want to minimize performance impact while still capturing debugging information for failed tests?**

A) `trace: 'on'` - Always record traces for every test  
B) `trace: 'on-first-retry'` - Record traces only when tests fail and are retried  
C) `trace: 'off'` - Never record traces  
D) `trace: 'retain-on-failure'` - Record traces for all tests but only keep them if tests fail  

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:** 
`'on-first-retry'` is ideal for CI/CD because it balances performance with debugging capability. It only creates traces when tests fail and are retried, which means:
- No performance impact for passing tests
- Debugging information is available when needed most (test failures)
- Minimal storage usage compared to always tracing
- Automatic cleanup for successful tests

Option A (`'on'`) would slow down all tests and use excessive storage. Option C (`'off'`) provides no debugging capability. Option D (`'retain-on-failure'`) records traces for all tests initially, which impacts performance even for passing tests.

## Question 2: Trace Viewer Interface

**In the Playwright Trace Viewer, what information can you find in the Details Panel (right side) when you select a specific action?**

A) Only the action name and timestamp  
B) Browser console logs and network requests  
C) Action parameters, element selector, execution time, and error messages  
D) DOM snapshot and page screenshots  

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
The Details Panel provides comprehensive information about the selected action:
- **Action Parameters**: The arguments passed to the Playwright method
- **Element Selector**: The locator used to find the target element
- **Execution Time**: How long the action took to complete
- **Error Messages**: Detailed error information if the action failed

Option A is too limited. Option B describes the Network and Console tabs, not the Details Panel. Option D describes the DOM Snapshot area in the center panel.

## Question 3: Time-Travel Debugging

**You're debugging a test that fails when trying to click a submit button. The error message says "Element is not clickable". Using the Trace Viewer's time-travel feature, what would be the most effective debugging approach?**

A) Only look at the failed click action to see the error message  
B) Navigate to the click action, examine the DOM snapshot, then go back to previous actions to understand how the page state evolved  
C) Check the Network tab to see if there were any failed API requests  
D) Look at the Console tab to find JavaScript errors  

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
Time-travel debugging is most effective when you:
1. **Start at the failure point** - Navigate to the failed click action to see the page state when the error occurred
2. **Examine the current state** - Look at the DOM snapshot to see if the button is covered, disabled, or positioned incorrectly
3. **Trace backwards** - Go to previous actions to understand what led to this state
4. **Compare states** - Use before/after views to see how the page changed

This systematic approach helps identify root causes like:
- Modal dialogs covering the button
- CSS animations still in progress
- Form validation preventing interaction
- Timing issues with dynamic content

Options A, C, and D might provide useful information but don't leverage the time-travel capability effectively.

## Question 4: Trace File Management

**Your team is experiencing issues with large trace files consuming too much disk space in your CI/CD pipeline. What configuration changes would help address this while maintaining debugging capability?**

A) Set `trace: 'off'` to disable all tracing  
B) Change from `trace: 'on'` to `trace: 'on-first-retry'` and implement regular cleanup  
C) Keep `trace: 'on'` but reduce the number of tests  
D) Use `trace: 'retain-on-failure'` and never clean up trace files  

**Correct Answer: B**

**Explanation:**
The best approach combines configuration optimization with maintenance practices:

**Configuration Change**: `'on-first-retry'` instead of `'on'`
- Only generates traces when tests fail and retry
- Eliminates traces for successful tests (majority of cases)
- Maintains debugging capability for failures

**Regular Cleanup**: Implement automated cleanup
- Remove old trace files after a certain period
- Clean up traces from successful builds
- Archive important traces for later analysis

Option A eliminates debugging capability entirely. Option C doesn't address the root cause (trace generation). Option D would actually make the problem worse by keeping all failure traces indefinitely.

**Additional Best Practices:**
```typescript
// Optimized CI configuration
export default defineConfig({
  use: {
    trace: 'on-first-retry',
    screenshot: 'only-on-failure',
    video: 'retain-on-failure',
  },
  // Cleanup after 7 days
  reporter: [['html', { outputFolder: 'playwright-report' }]],
});
```

## Question 5: Network and Console Analysis

**While analyzing a trace for a failed form submission test, you notice in the Network tab that a POST request to `/api/submit` returned a 500 status code. In the Console tab, you see a JavaScript error: "Cannot read property 'data' of undefined". What does this information tell you about the test failure?**

A) The test failed because of a network connectivity issue  
B) The test failed because the form data was invalid  
C) The test failed due to a server-side error that caused a client-side JavaScript error when processing the response  
D) The test failed because the Playwright locators were incorrect  

**Correct Answer: C**

**Explanation:**
This scenario demonstrates a cascading failure:

1. **Server-Side Issue**: The 500 status code indicates an internal server error
2. **Client-Side Impact**: The JavaScript error suggests the frontend code expected a successful response with a `data` property
3. **Test Failure**: The test likely failed because the expected success behavior didn't occur

**Analysis Process:**
- **Network Tab**: Shows the API call failed (500 error)
- **Console Tab**: Shows the frontend couldn't handle the error response
- **DOM Snapshot**: Would likely show an error state or missing success message

**Common Pattern:**
```javascript
// Frontend code might look like:
fetch('/api/submit', { method: 'POST', body: formData })
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    // This fails if server returns 500 and no 'data' property
    displayMessage(data.data.message);
  });
```

Option A is incorrect because the request reached the server. Option B is wrong because 500 errors are server-side issues, not client validation problems. Option D is incorrect because the locators successfully found and interacted with elements (the form was submitted).

## Bonus Question: Advanced Trace Features

**You want to add custom annotations to your traces to mark important business logic steps. Which approach would be most effective?**

A) Add comments in your test code  
B) Use [`console.log()`](../../../../console.log()) statements with a consistent prefix like "TRACE:"  
C) Use [`page.evaluate()`](../../../../page.evaluate()) to add console logs from the browser context  
D) Both B and C, depending on whether you want to mark test logic or browser state  

**Correct Answer: D**

**Explanation:**
Both approaches serve different but complementary purposes:

**Option B - Test Context Annotations:**
```typescript
test('user workflow', async ({ page }) => {
  console.log('TRACE: Starting user login flow');
  await page.goto('/login');
  
  console.log('TRACE: Filling credentials');
  await page.fill('#username', 'user');
  
  console.log('TRACE: Submitting form');
  await page.click('#submit');
});
```
- Marks test logic steps
- Appears in the Console tab
- Helps understand test progression

**Option C - Browser Context Annotations:**
```typescript
test('complex interaction', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/app');
  
  await page.evaluate(() => {
    console.log('CUSTOM_TRACE: Application state loaded');
  });
  
  // Complex interactions
  await page.evaluate(() => {
    console.log('CUSTOM_TRACE: About to trigger complex workflow');
  });
});
```
- Marks browser state changes
- Provides context about application behavior
- Useful for debugging timing issues

**Best Practice**: Use both approaches strategically:
- Test-level logs for test structure and flow
- Browser-level logs for application state and timing
- Consistent prefixes for easy filtering
- Meaningful descriptions that help during debugging

Option A (comments) don't appear in traces. Using only B or C misses important context from the other perspective.
