# Lesson 04: The Trace Viewer

## Overview

This lesson introduces learners to one of Playwright's most powerful debugging tools - the Trace Viewer. Students will learn how to configure tracing, generate trace files, and use the interactive Trace Viewer interface to debug test failures effectively.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, learners will be able to:

1. **Understand Tracing Concepts**
   - Explain what the Playwright Trace Viewer is and its importance for debugging
   - Identify when and why to use tracing in different environments

2. **Configure Tracing**
   - Set up tracing in [`playwright.config.ts`](../../../playwright.config.ts) using different modes
   - Choose appropriate trace configurations for development vs. production environments

3. **Generate and Access Traces**
   - Run tests to create trace files
   - Locate and open trace files using the Playwright CLI

4. **Navigate the Trace Viewer Interface**
   - Use the timeline, action list, DOM snapshots, network tab, and console tab
   - Understand the different panels and their purposes

5. **Perform Time-Travel Debugging**
   - Navigate through test execution step-by-step
   - Compare page states before and after actions
   - Identify root causes of test failures

6. **Apply Advanced Debugging Techniques**
   - Add custom trace annotations for better debugging context
   - Analyze network requests and console output
   - Troubleshoot common trace-related issues

## Prerequisites

## Key Concepts

### Trace Modes
- **`'on'`**: Always record traces (development)
- **`'on-first-retry'`**: Record only on test failures (CI/CD)
- **`'off'`**: Disable tracing (performance-critical environments)
- **`'retain-on-failure'`**: Keep traces only for failed tests

### Trace Viewer Components
- **Timeline**: Visual representation of test execution
- **Action List**: Chronological list of all Playwright actions
- **DOM Snapshot**: Interactive page state at any point in time
- **Details Panel**: Action parameters, selectors, and error information
- **Network Tab**: HTTP requests and responses
- **Console Tab**: Browser console output and custom logs

### Debugging Workflow
1. **Configure appropriate tracing** for your environment
2. **Run tests** to generate trace files
3. **Open traces** using [`npx playwright show-trace`](../../../npx playwright show-trace)
4. **Navigate to failure points** using the timeline or action list
5. **Examine page state** using DOM snapshots
6. **Trace backwards** to understand how the failure occurred
7. **Analyze network and console data** for additional context

## Skills Developed

## Real-World Applications

### Development Environment
- **Debug failing tests** during development
- **Understand complex user workflows** through visual timeline
- **Optimize test performance** by analyzing action timing
- **Document test behavior** for team collaboration

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Investigate intermittent failures** in automated builds
