# Lesson 6: Waiting Strategies

## 1. The Challenge of Modern Web Apps

Modern web applications are dynamic. Content can load at any time, animations can delay the appearance of elements, and network requests can take a variable amount of time to complete.

This can lead to "flaky" testsâ€”tests that sometimes pass and sometimes fail. This usually happens because the test tries to interact with an element before it's ready.

## 2. Playwright's Auto-Waiting to the Rescue

As we learned in the previous lesson, Playwright has a powerful auto-waiting mechanism. Before performing any action on an element, Playwright automatically waits for it to be in a "hittable" state. This means the element is:

-   Attached to the DOM.
-   Visible.
-   Stable (not animating).
-   Enabled.
-   Receives events.

This solves most of our waiting problems automatically!

## 3. When to Use Explicit Waits

Sometimes, auto-waiting isn't enough. You might need to wait for a specific condition to be met before proceeding. For example, you might need to wait for a network request to finish or for a specific piece of text to appear.

Playwright provides several ways to handle these scenarios:

### a. `waitForSelector`

This is the most common way to wait for an element to appear on the page.

```typescript
await page.waitForSelector('.my-element');
```

### b. `waitForFunction`

You can wait for a custom condition to be met using `waitForFunction`.

```typescript
await page.waitForFunction(() => {
  const element = document.querySelector('.my-element');
  return element && element.textContent === 'Hello, World!';
});
```

### c. `waitForTimeout`

You can also wait for a fixed amount of time, but **this should be your last resort**. It can lead to slow and flaky tests.

```typescript
await page.waitForTimeout(5000); // wait for 5 seconds
```

## 4. Example

Let's imagine a scenario where we click a button, and a new element appears after a delay.

```typescript
test('should wait for an element to appear', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('my-app.com');

  // Click a button that loads a new element
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Load Data' }).click();

  // Use an assertion to wait for the element to be visible
  const newElement = page.locator('.new-data');
  await expect(newElement).toBeVisible();
});
```

In this example, `expect(newElement).toBeVisible()` will automatically wait for the element to appear before the test continues.

## 5. Best Practices

-   **Rely on auto-waiting whenever possible.**
-   **Use locator assertions (`expect(locator).toBeVisible()`) for explicit waits.**
-   **Avoid fixed timeouts (`waitForTimeout`).**
-   **If you need to wait for a complex condition, use `waitForFunction`.**
