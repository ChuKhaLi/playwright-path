# Lesson 3: Understanding Locators and Selectors

## Learning Objectives
After completing this lesson, you will be able to:
- Define what a locator is and why it's central to Playwright.
- Use Playwright's recommended locators, such as `getByRole`, `getByText`, and `getByLabel`.
- Understand the difference between locators and traditional selectors (like CSS or XPath).
- Use the Playwright Inspector to find the best locator for an element.
- Appreciate the benefits of Playwright's auto-waiting and web-first assertions.

## 1. What are Locators?

In Playwright, a **locator** is an object that represents a way to find an element (or elements) on a page at any moment. It's the primary tool for all interactions. Unlike traditional DOM queries that capture an element at a specific point in time, a locator is a dynamic query that is re-evaluated whenever you perform an action or assertion on it.

This is a key concept. It means you can define a locator once and use it multiple times. Playwright will find the element fresh from the DOM every time you use the locator, which makes your tests much more resilient to changes in the web application.

## 2. Playwright's Recommended Locators

Playwright strongly recommends using user-facing attributes to find elements, as this is how real users interact with your site. This makes your tests more robust and less likely to break when the underlying HTML structure changes.

Here are the most important locators to start with:

### `page.getByRole()`
This is the best-practice locator. It finds elements based on their ARIA role, which is how assistive technologies (like screen readers) perceive the page.

```typescript
// Find a button by its accessible name
await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Sign in' }).click();

// Find a heading
const heading = page.getByRole('heading', { name: 'Welcome back!' });
await expect(heading).toBeVisible();
```

### `page.getByText()`
Finds an element that contains the given text.

```typescript
// Find an element with the exact text "Welcome"
await page.getByText('Welcome').click();

// Find an element that contains the text "Product" (case-insensitive)
const productLink = page.getByText(/product/i);
await expect(productLink).toBeVisible();
```

### `page.getByLabel()`
Finds a form control by its associated `<label>` text. This is the best way to interact with form fields.

```typescript
// Find an input field associated with a label "Username"
await page.getByLabel('Username').fill('my-username');
```

### Other Useful User-Facing Locators
- **`page.getByPlaceholder()`**: Finds an input by its placeholder text.
- **`page.getByAltText()`**: Finds an image by its `alt` text.
- **`page.getByTitle()`**: Finds an element by its `title` attribute.

## 3. When to Use CSS and XPath Selectors

While user-facing locators are preferred, sometimes you need to fall back to more traditional selectors.

- **`page.locator('css=...')`** or **`page.locator('.my-class')`**: Finds an element using a CSS selector. This is useful when an element has no user-visible attributes, but has a stable class or ID.
- **`page.locator('xpath=...')`** or **`page.locator('//div/button')`**: Finds an element using an XPath expression. This should be your last resort, as XPath selectors can be brittle.

**Example:**
```typescript
// Using a CSS selector to find an element by its data-testid attribute
await page.locator('[data-testid="submit-button"]').click();
```
Using a `data-testid` attribute is a common and recommended practice for elements that are hard to select otherwise. It provides a stable hook for testing that is decoupled from the element's styling or structure.

## 4. The Playwright Inspector: Your Best Friend

How do you find the best locator for an element? Playwright provides an excellent tool called the **Inspector**.

To launch the Inspector, run your test with the `--debug` flag:

```powershell
npx playwright test --debug
```

This will:
1.  Open a browser window with your test paused at the first step.
2.  Open the Playwright Inspector window.

In the Inspector, you can:
- **Step through your test:** Execute your test line by line.
- **Explore the DOM:** Hover over elements in the browser to see their locators.
- **Pick a Locator:** Click the "Pick locator" button and then click on any element on the page. The Inspector will suggest the best locator for that element.

The Inspector is the fastest and most reliable way to write new tests and debug existing ones.

## 5. Auto-Waiting and Web-First Assertions

A major advantage of using locators is **auto-waiting**. Whenever you perform an action (like `.click()`) or an assertion (like `expect(...).toBeVisible()`), Playwright automatically waits for the element to be in the correct state.

For example, if you write `await page.getByRole('button').click();`, Playwright will automatically:
1.  Wait for the element to exist in the DOM.
2.  Wait for it to be visible.
3.  Wait for it to be stable (not animating).
4.  Wait for it to be enabled.
5.  Scroll it into view.
6.  Then, and only then, perform the click.

This eliminates a huge source of flakiness in E2E tests. You rarely need to write manual waits (`page.waitForTimeout()`), which is a common anti-pattern.

## Summary

In this lesson, you learned about Playwright's core concept of locators. You now understand how to use user-facing locators like `getByRole`, `getByText`, and `getByLabel` to create robust and reliable tests. You also know how to use the Playwright Inspector to find the best locators and appreciate the power of auto-waiting. In the next lesson, you'll put this knowledge into practice by interacting with various web elements.
