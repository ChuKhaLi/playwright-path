## 🛠️ Key Concepts Covered

### **Docker Fundamentals**
- **Containerization**: Lightweight virtualization technology
- **Images**: Read-only templates for creating containers
- **Containers**: Running instances of Docker images
- **Registries**: Storage and distribution of Docker images

### **Testing-Specific Configurations**
- **Browser Dependencies**: Installing and configuring browsers
- **Test Data Management**: Handling test files and databases
- **Environment Isolation**: Consistent testing environments
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient resource utilization

## 📋 Hands-on Exercises

### **Exercise 1: Basic Testing Container**
Create a Docker image that:
- Uses Node.js base image
- Installs Playwright and browsers
- Configures test environment
- Runs basic test suite

### **Exercise 2: Multi-Stage Build Optimization**
Implement multi-stage build for:
- Development dependencies separation
- Production-ready test image
- Size optimization techniques
- Layer caching strategies

### **Exercise 3: Container Configuration**
Configure containers with:
- Environment-specific variables
- Volume mounting for test results
- Network access for external services
- Resource limits and constraints

## 🎯 Practical Applications

### **Testing Scenarios**
- **Consistent Environments**: Same testing environment across teams
- **Isolation**: Preventing test interference and conflicts
- **Scalability**: Easy scaling of test execution
- **Portability**: Running tests anywhere Docker is available
