# Lesson 3: Docker Fundamentals for Testing

## Introduction

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers allow you to package your application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development.

## Core Concepts

### Docker Image

A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

### Docker Container

A Docker container is a running instance of a Docker image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI.

### Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image.

## Summary

In this lesson, you learned about the fundamentals of Docker and how to use it to containerize your Playwright tests. This knowledge is essential for creating consistent and reproducible testing environments in a CI/CD pipeline.
