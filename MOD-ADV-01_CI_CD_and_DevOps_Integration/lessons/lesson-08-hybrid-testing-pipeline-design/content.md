# Lesson 8: Hybrid Testing Pipeline Design

## Introduction

A hybrid testing pipeline is a CI/CD pipeline that combines different types of automated tests, such as unit, integration, API, and end-to-end tests. This approach provides a more comprehensive and efficient way to ensure the quality of your application.

## Designing a Hybrid Pipeline

When designing a hybrid pipeline, it's important to consider the "testing pyramid" and run faster, more focused tests first. A typical hybrid pipeline might look like this:

1.  **Unit Tests:** Run first to provide the fastest feedback.
2.  **Component Tests:** Test individual components in isolation.
3.  **API Tests:** Test the application's API endpoints.
4.  **End-to-End Tests:** Test the application from the user's perspective.

## Summary

In this lesson, you learned how to design and implement a hybrid testing pipeline. By combining different types of tests, you can create a more robust and efficient testing strategy that provides comprehensive coverage and fast feedback.
