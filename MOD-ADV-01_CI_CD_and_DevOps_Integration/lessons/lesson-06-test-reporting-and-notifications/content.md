# Lesson 6: Test Reporting and Notifications

## Introduction

Test reports and notifications are essential for providing visibility into the health of your application and for enabling fast feedback loops. Playwright has a flexible reporting system that can be customized to meet your needs.

## Playwright Reporters

Playwright comes with several built-in reporters, including:

*   `list`: Prints a summary of the test results to the console.
*   `html`: Generates a self-contained HTML report with detailed information about each test run.
*   `json`: Outputs a JSON file with the test results.
*   `junit`: Creates a report in the JUnit XML format, which is widely supported by CI/CD tools.

## Notifications

Notifications are a great way to keep your team informed about the status of your tests. You can integrate your CI/CD pipeline with services like Slack or Microsoft Teams to send notifications when tests fail.

## Summary

In this lesson, you learned how to configure test reports and notifications in your CI/CD pipeline. Effective reporting and notifications are key to maintaining a healthy and efficient development process.
