# Lesson 4: Containerized Testing in CI/CD

## Introduction

Running tests in a containerized environment is a best practice for modern CI/CD pipelines. It ensures that your tests run in a consistent and isolated environment, regardless of the underlying infrastructure.

## Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

## Integrating with GitHub Actions

You can integrate Docker and Docker Compose into your GitHub Actions workflows to build, test, and deploy your applications in a containerized environment. This can be done by installing Docker on the runner, using dedicated actions like `docker/build-push-action`, or by using a `container` job.

## Summary

In this lesson, you learned how to integrate containerized testing into your CI/CD pipeline using Docker, Docker Compose, and GitHub Actions. This approach provides a robust and reliable way to run your tests in a consistent environment.
