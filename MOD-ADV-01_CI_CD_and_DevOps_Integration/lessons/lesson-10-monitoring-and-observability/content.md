# Lesson 10: Monitoring and Observability

## Introduction

Monitoring and observability are crucial for understanding the health and performance of your systems. In a CI/CD context, they help you to identify and debug issues in your pipeline and to understand the impact of your changes on the production environment.

## Monitoring vs. Observability

**Monitoring** is the process of collecting, processing, and displaying real-time quantitative data about a system. **Observability**, on the other hand, is the ability to measure a systemâ€™s current state based on the data it generates, such as logs, metrics, and traces.

## The Three Pillars of Observability

1.  **Logs:** A log is an immutable, timestamped record of a discrete event that happened over time.
2.  **Metrics:** A metric is a numeric representation of data measured over intervals of time.
3.  **Traces:** A trace represents the end-to-end journey of a request through a system.

## Summary

In this lesson, you learned about the importance of monitoring and observability in a modern CI/CD pipeline. By applying the principles of observability, you can build more reliable and resilient systems.
