# Lesson 7: API Testing in CI/CD Pipelines

## Introduction

API testing is a critical part of a comprehensive testing strategy. By testing your APIs directly, you can get faster feedback and catch bugs earlier in the development process. Playwright's `request` fixture makes it easy to write and run API tests.

## Writing API Tests

Playwright's `request` fixture provides a simple and powerful way to make HTTP requests and assertions. You can use it to test your REST and GraphQL APIs.

## Running API Tests in CI/CD

You can run your API tests in the same CI/CD pipeline as your end-to-end tests. This allows you to get a complete picture of your application's health with every code change.

## Summary

In this lesson, you learned how to integrate API testing into your CI/CD pipeline using Playwright. This is a crucial step towards building a robust and reliable testing strategy.
