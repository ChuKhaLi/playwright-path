## üß© Part 2: Problem-Solving Scenarios (25 points)

### **Scenario 1: Performance Degradation (8 points)**

**Problem**: The Orders API is experiencing performance degradation in production. Response times have increased from 200ms to 2000ms average, and the error rate has jumped to 15%.

**Your Task**: Design a comprehensive testing strategy to:
1. Identify the root cause of performance issues
2. Implement automated performance regression detection
3. Create alerts for performance threshold violations
4. Design a rollback strategy based on performance metrics

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- [ ] Root cause analysis approach is systematic (2 points)
- [ ] Performance regression detection is automated (2 points)
- [ ] Alerting strategy is comprehensive (2 points)
- [ ] Rollback strategy is well-designed (2 points)

### **Scenario 2: Breaking Change Management (8 points)**

**Problem**: The Products API team wants to remove a deprecated field (`legacy_id`) from the API response. However, several downstream services still depend on this field.

**Your Task**: Design a strategy to:
1. Identify all consumers of the deprecated field
2. Implement contract testing to prevent breaking changes
3. Create a migration plan for downstream services
4. Design a safe deployment strategy

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- [ ] Consumer identification strategy is thorough (2 points)
- [ ] Contract testing prevents breaking changes (2 points)
- [ ] Migration plan is comprehensive (2 points)
- [ ] Deployment strategy minimizes risk (2 points)

### **Scenario 3: Third-Party Integration Testing (9 points)**

**Problem**: The Payments API integrates with multiple third-party payment providers (Stripe, PayPal, Square). These integrations are unreliable in test environments and expensive to test against.

**Your Task**: Design a testing strategy that:
1. Handles unreliable third-party services
2. Minimizes costs while maintaining test coverage
3. Validates integration contracts without hitting real services
4. Ensures production readiness

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- [ ] Strategy handles unreliable services effectively (3 points)
- [ ] Cost optimization is well-considered (2 points)
- [ ] Contract validation doesn't require real services (2 points)
- [ ] Production readiness is ensured (2 points)
