# Lesson 5: Parallel Execution and Optimization

## Lesson Overview

This lesson covers strategies for speeding up your test suite by running tests in parallel and optimizing your CI/CD pipeline. You will learn how to configure parallel execution in Playwright and how to use test sharding to distribute your tests across multiple machines.

## Learning Objectives

*   Understand the benefits of parallel test execution.
*   Configure Playwright to run tests in parallel using multiple workers.
*   Implement test sharding to distribute tests across multiple CI/CD jobs.
*   Optimize your CI/CD pipeline for faster feedback.
