# Lesson 5: Parallel Execution and Optimization

## Introduction

As your test suite grows, it can take a long time to run, which slows down your development feedback loop. Running tests in parallel is a crucial technique for reducing the overall execution time of your test suite.

## Parallel Execution in Playwright

Playwright has built-in support for running tests in parallel. You can configure the number of worker processes to use for parallel execution in your `playwright.config.ts` file.

## Test Sharding

Test sharding is a technique for splitting your test suite into multiple "shards" that can be run on different machines or in different CI/CD jobs. This is a powerful way to parallelize your tests and get faster feedback.

## Summary

In this lesson, you learned how to speed up your test suite by running tests in parallel and using test sharding. These optimization techniques are essential for maintaining a fast and efficient CI/CD pipeline.
