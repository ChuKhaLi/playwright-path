# Lesson 2: Advanced GitHub Actions Workflows

## Introduction

In this lesson, you will learn about advanced features of GitHub Actions that allow you to create more powerful and flexible workflows. These features include matrix strategies, artifacts, and job dependencies.

## Matrix Strategies

A matrix strategy lets you use variables in a single job definition to automatically create multiple job runs that are based on the combinations of the variables. For example, you can use a matrix strategy to test your code on multiple versions of a language or on multiple operating systems.

## Artifacts

Artifacts allow you to share data between jobs in a workflow and store data once a workflow has completed. An artifact is a file or collection of files produced during a workflow run.

## Job Dependencies

By default, jobs in a workflow run in parallel. If you have a job that must run after another job has completed, you can use the `needs` keyword to create a dependency.

## Summary

In this lesson, you learned about advanced GitHub Actions features like matrix strategies, artifacts, and job dependencies. These features enable you to create more complex, efficient, and maintainable CI/CD pipelines.
