# Lesson 2: Advanced GitHub Actions Workflows

## Lesson Overview

This lesson builds upon the fundamentals of GitHub Actions and introduces advanced concepts for creating more complex and efficient workflows. You will learn how to use matrix strategies, share data between jobs, and control the execution flow of your workflows.

## Learning Objectives

*   Use a `matrix` strategy to run jobs with different configurations.
*   Share data between jobs using `artifacts`.
*   Control the execution order of jobs using the `needs` keyword.
*   Use `environment variables` and `secrets` to manage sensitive data.
*   Create reusable workflows to avoid code duplication.
