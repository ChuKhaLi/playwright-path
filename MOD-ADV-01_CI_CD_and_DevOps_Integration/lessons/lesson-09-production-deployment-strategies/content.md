# Lesson 9: Production Deployment Strategies

## Introduction

Choosing the right deployment strategy is crucial for ensuring the stability and reliability of your production environment. Different strategies offer different trade-offs between speed, safety, and complexity.

## Common Deployment Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployment

In a blue-green deployment, you have two identical production environments: "blue" and "green". At any given time, only one of the environments is live. To deploy a new version of your application, you deploy it to the inactive environment and then switch traffic over to it.

### Canary Deployment

In a canary deployment, you roll out the new version of your application to a small subset of your users before rolling it out to everyone. This allows you to test the new version in a production environment with minimal impact on your users.

### Rolling Deployment

In a rolling deployment, you slowly replace instances of the old version of your application with instances of the new version. This allows for zero-downtime deployments.

## Summary

In this lesson, you learned about common production deployment strategies and their trade-offs. Choosing the right strategy is a key part of a successful DevOps culture.
