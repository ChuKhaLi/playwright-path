# Project: Comprehensive CI/CD Pipeline

## Objective

The goal of this project is to build a comprehensive, production-ready CI/CD pipeline for a full-stack application. This pipeline will incorporate best practices for automated testing, containerization, and deployment.

## Features

*   **Automated Testing:** A hybrid testing strategy that includes unit, integration, API, and end-to-end tests.
*   **Containerization:** The application and its dependencies will be containerized using Docker.
*   **CI/CD:** A GitHub Actions workflow will automate the build, test, and deployment process.
*   **Deployment:** The project will include a deployment strategy, such as blue-green or canary.
*   **Monitoring:** The pipeline will be integrated with a monitoring and observability tool.

## Technologies

*   **Frontend:** React or Vue.js
*   **Backend:** Node.js with Express
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL or MongoDB
*   **Testing:** Playwright for E2E and API tests, Jest or Vitest for unit and integration tests
*   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions
*   **Containerization:** Docker and Docker Compose
*   **Monitoring:** Prometheus and Grafana, or a cloud-based service like Datadog
