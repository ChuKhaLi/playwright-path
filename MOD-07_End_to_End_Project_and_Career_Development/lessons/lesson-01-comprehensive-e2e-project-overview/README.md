#### Design Patterns and Principles

**Page Object Model (POM)**
- Encapsulate page-specific functionality
- Maintain separation between test logic and UI interaction
- Promote code reusability and maintainability

**API Client Pattern**
- Abstract API interactions into dedicated client classes
- Provide type-safe interfaces for API requests and responses
- Enable easy mocking and testing of API integrations

**Configuration Management**
- Environment-specific configuration files
- Secure handling of credentials and sensitive data
- Easy switching between test environments
