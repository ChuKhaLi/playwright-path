        "Utility functions and helpers",
        "Reporting and logging",
        "CI/CD integration"
      ],
      exampleAnswer: "I'd start with a layered architecture using the Page Object Model. The foundation would include base classes for pages and API clients, providing common functionality like navigation, waiting strategies, and error handling. I'd implement a configuration system for environment-specific settings, utilities for data generation and logging, and integrate with CI/CD pipelines for automated execution. The framework would emphasize maintainability through clear separation of concerns and reusable components.",

        "async/await patterns",
        "Performance implications",
        "Error handling differences"
      ],
      exampleAnswer: "Synchronous testing executes operations sequentially, blocking until each action completes. Asynchronous testing allows multiple operations to run concurrently using promises. In Playwright, most operations are asynchronous, requiring async/await patterns. This improves performance by allowing parallel execution and better resource utilization. Async patterns also enable more sophisticated waiting strategies and better handling of dynamic web applications.",
      followUpQuestions: [
        "How do you handle race conditions in async tests?",
        "What are the benefits of parallel test execution?",

        "Problem-solving approach",
        "Collaboration with stakeholders",
        "Lessons learned",
        "Measurable outcomes"
      ],
      exampleAnswer: "I led the development of a comprehensive E2E automation framework for a complex e-commerce application. The main challenge was handling dynamic content and varying load times across different environments. I solved this by implementing intelligent waiting strategies using Playwright's web-first assertions, creating a robust configuration system for environment differences, and establishing monitoring to track performance patterns. The result was a 80% reduction in test flakiness and improved reliability across all environments.",

        "End-to-end testing approach",
        "Test data management",
        "Monitoring and observability"
      ],
      exampleAnswer: "I'd implement a testing pyramid approach: unit tests for individual services, contract tests to verify service interfaces, integration tests for service interactions, and selective E2E tests for critical user journeys. I'd use tools like Pact for contract testing, implement service virtualization for isolation, and create comprehensive monitoring to detect issues early. The strategy would emphasize fast feedback loops and minimal cross-service dependencies in testing.",

# Negotiation Timeline and Best Practices

## Phase 1: Preparation (Before Offer)
- Research market salaries for your location and experience
- Document your achievements and value proposition
- Identify your minimum acceptable terms
- Prepare justification for each compensation element

## Phase 2: Initial Offer Response (24-48 hours)
- Express gratitude and enthusiasm
- Request time to review if needed
- Ask clarifying questions about benefits
- Don't immediately accept or reject

## Phase 3: Negotiation (2-5 business days)
- Present your counteroffer professionally
- Focus on value you bring to the organization
- Be prepared to justify each request
- Show flexibility and willingness to collaborate

## Phase 4: Final Agreement (1-3 business days)
- Review final terms carefully
- Get agreement in writing
- Confirm start date and next steps
- Maintain positive relationships throughout

## Key Principles
- **Be Professional**: Maintain respectful tone throughout
- **Be Prepared**: Have data to support your requests
- **Be Flexible**: Consider total compensation package
- **Be Realistic**: Understand company constraints
- **Be Confident**: You have valuable skills to offer

## Red Flags to Avoid
- Ultimatums or aggressive tactics
- Comparing only salary numbers
- Negotiating every single detail
- Taking too long to respond
- Burning bridges if deal doesn't work out
