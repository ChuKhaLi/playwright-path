      "Why TypeScript over JavaScript?": 
        "TypeScript provides compile-time error detection, better IDE support, and improved maintainability through strong typing. In automation frameworks, this prevents runtime errors and makes refactoring safer.",
      
      "How does your framework handle flaky tests?":
        "We implement retry mechanisms, smart waits using Playwright's web-first assertions, and detailed logging for failure analysis. The framework also includes screenshot capture on failures for visual debugging.",
      
      "What's your approach to test data management?":
        "We use the Factory pattern for test data generation, environment-specific configuration files, and cleanup strategies. This ensures test isolation and repeatability across environments.",
      
      "How do you ensure cross-browser consistency?":
        "The framework uses Playwright's unified API across browsers, implements browser-specific configuration when needed, and includes visual regression testing to catch rendering differences.",
      
      "What's your CI/CD integration strategy?":
        "GitHub Actions workflow includes quality gates, parallel execution, and comprehensive reporting. Failed tests automatically notify the team via Slack with detailed failure information."
