# Lesson 5: Advanced Mocking and Virtualization

This lesson covers advanced techniques for isolating services and creating stable, predictable test environments using mocking and service virtualization.

## Learning Objectives

-   Understand the difference between mocking, stubbing, and service virtualization.
-   Implement API mocking directly within Playwright for component-level tests.
-   Learn about dedicated service virtualization tools (e.g., WireMock, Mountebank).
-   Design and implement strategies for testing services in isolation within a microservices architecture.
-   Use service virtualization to simulate complex scenarios, such as third-party API failures, latency, and specific data responses.
