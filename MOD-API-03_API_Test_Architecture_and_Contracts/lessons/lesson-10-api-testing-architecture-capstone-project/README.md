# Lesson 10: API Testing Architecture Capstone Project

Welcome to the final lesson of the API Test Architecture and Contracts module. This capstone project is your opportunity to apply all the principles, patterns, and strategies you've learned to build a complete, enterprise-grade API testing solution for a realistic application.

## Learning Objectives

-   Apply architectural principles to design a scalable and maintainable test framework.
-   Implement a multi-layered API testing framework using advanced design patterns (Repository, Factory, Builder).
-   Integrate multiple forms of testing: functional, contract, and schema validation.
-   Develop a comprehensive testing strategy for a microservices-based application.
-   Present and justify your architectural decisions and testing strategy.

## Project Overview

You will act as the Lead Test Architect for a new project: **"BookSpot,"** a simplified online bookstore. Your task is to design and build the complete API testing solution from the ground up.

### The BookSpot Application

BookSpot consists of three core microservices:
1.  **UserService:** Manages user accounts and authentication.
2.  **BookService:** Manages the book inventory.
3.  **OrderService:** Manages customer orders, interacting with both the `UserService` and `BookService`.

You will be provided with OpenAPI specifications for each of these services.
