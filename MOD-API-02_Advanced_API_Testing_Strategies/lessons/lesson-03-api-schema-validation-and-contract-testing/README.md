# Lesson 3: API Schema Validation and Contract Testing

## Overview

This lesson introduces two critical, related concepts in API testing: Schema Validation and Contract Testing. These techniques help ensure the reliability and stability of APIs, especially in a microservices architecture where different services depend on each other's APIs.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the purpose and importance of API schemas (e.g., OpenAPI, JSON Schema).
- Learn how to validate API responses against a defined schema.
- Grasp the concept of contract testing and its role in preventing breaking changes.
- Implement schema validation in Playwright tests using a library like Zod or Ajv.

## Topics Covered

- What is an API Schema?
- Introduction to JSON Schema and OpenAPI/Swagger.
- The importance of validating the "shape" of an API response.
- What is Contract Testing?
- Consumer-Driven vs. Provider-Driven contract testing.
- Implementing schema validation in Playwright.
- Tools and libraries for schema validation.
