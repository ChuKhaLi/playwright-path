# Lesson 12: API Monitoring and Observability Testing

## Overview

Testing isn't just about what happens *before* a release; it's also about ensuring quality in production. This lesson introduces the concepts of monitoring and observability, and explores how testing can validate and leverage these systems to build more resilient APIs.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the difference between monitoring and observability.
- Learn about the three pillars of observability: logs, metrics, and traces.
- Develop strategies for testing an API's instrumentation.
- Write tests that check for the presence and correctness of structured logs.
- Use distributed tracing information to debug and understand complex requests.

## Topics Covered

- Monitoring vs. Observability.
- The Three Pillars: Logs, Metrics, Traces.
- Structured Logging and how to test it.
- Key API metrics to monitor (e.g., latency, error rate, throughput).
- Introduction to Distributed Tracing.
- Validating trace propagation and context.
- "Testing in Production" concepts.
