# Lesson 11: API Testing in Microservices Architecture

## Overview

Microservices architecture structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. This architecture presents unique challenges and opportunities for testing. This lesson explores effective API testing strategies tailored for a microservices environment.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the testing challenges in a microservices architecture.
- Learn about the different levels of testing in a microservices world (unit, component, integration, contract, E2E).
- Differentiate between intra-service and inter-service testing.
- Develop strategies for testing service-to-service communication.
- Understand the role of contract testing in ensuring service compatibility.

## Topics Covered

- Introduction to Microservices Architecture.
- The Testing Pyramid in a Microservices Context.
- Component Testing: Testing a single service in isolation.
- Integration Testing: Testing the interaction between two or more services.
- The role of mocking and service virtualization.
- Consumer-Driven Contract Testing as a key strategy.
- End-to-End (E2E) testing strategies for user journeys that span multiple services.
