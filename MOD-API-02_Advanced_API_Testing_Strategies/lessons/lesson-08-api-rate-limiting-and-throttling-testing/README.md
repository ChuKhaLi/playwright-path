# Lesson 8: API Rate Limiting and Throttling Testing

## Overview

To protect against abuse and ensure fair usage, public and private APIs often implement rate limiting and throttling. This lesson covers what these concepts are and how to design tests to verify that they are working correctly.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the purpose of API rate limiting and throttling.
- Learn how to read and interpret rate-limiting headers in an API response.
- Design tests to verify that the rate limit is enforced correctly.
- Write a test to ensure the API responds with the correct error code when the limit is exceeded.
- Develop strategies for handling rate limits in a large test suite.

## Topics Covered

- What is Rate Limiting?
- Common Rate Limiting Algorithms (e.g., Token Bucket).
- Standard Rate-Limiting HTTP Headers (`X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`).
- Testing the Rate Limit Boundary.
- Handling `429 Too Many Requests` status code.
- Strategies for avoiding rate limits in functional tests.
