# Lesson 6: API Versioning and Backward Compatibility Testing

## Overview

As applications evolve, their APIs must change. Managing these changes without breaking existing clients is a major challenge. This lesson explores common API versioning strategies and how to design tests to ensure backward compatibility.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the importance of API versioning.
- Learn about different versioning strategies (URL, header, query parameter).
- Develop a testing strategy to ensure new API versions don't break old clients.
- Write tests that cover multiple API versions.
- Understand the concept of "breaking" vs. "non-breaking" changes.

## Topics Covered

- Why version APIs?
- Versioning Strategies:
  - URI Versioning (`/v1/users`)
  - Header Versioning (`Accept: application/vnd.myapi.v1+json`)
  - Query Parameter Versioning (`/users?version=1`)
- Defining Breaking vs. Non-Breaking Changes.
- Testing for Backward Compatibility.
- Running the same test suite against multiple API versions.
