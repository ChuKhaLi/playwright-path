# Lesson 1: Advanced Request Configuration and Interceptors

## Overview

This lesson explores advanced techniques for configuring API requests in Playwright and introduces the concept of intercepting network requests. These capabilities are crucial for handling complex testing scenarios, such as modifying requests on the fly, mocking responses, and managing authentication tokens.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand how to set advanced configurations for API requests.
- Learn to intercept and modify API requests and responses.
- Implement request interception to mock API endpoints.
- Use interceptors for dynamic header manipulation.

## Topics Covered

- Advanced `request` fixture options
- Intercepting network requests with `page.route()`
- Modifying headers, bodies, and query parameters
- Mocking API responses for isolated testing
- Practical examples and hands-on exercises
