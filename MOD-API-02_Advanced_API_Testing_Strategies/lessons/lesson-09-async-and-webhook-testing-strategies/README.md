# Lesson 9: Async and Webhook Testing Strategies

## Overview

Not all API interactions follow a simple request-response pattern. Many modern systems use asynchronous processes, where a client makes a request and the server performs a long-running task in the background. Webhooks are a common way for the server to notify the client once the task is complete. This lesson covers strategies for testing these complex, asynchronous flows.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the challenges of testing asynchronous API operations.
- Learn how to test processes that involve message queues or background jobs.
- Grasp the concept of webhooks and how they work.
- Develop a strategy for testing webhook delivery and payload correctness.
- Use polling and other techniques to wait for an asynchronous process to complete.

## Topics Covered

- What are Asynchronous APIs?
- The Request-Acknowledge-Process-Notify pattern.
- Testing systems with message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, SQS).
- What are Webhooks?
- Tools for capturing and inspecting webhook deliveries (e.g., ngrok, webhook.site).
- Writing tests that trigger a process and then wait for a webhook callback.
