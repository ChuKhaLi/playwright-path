# Learning Objectives for MOD-API-02: Advanced API Testing Strategies

By completing this module, you will be able to:

- **Advanced Configuration**: Implement advanced request configurations and interceptors to handle complex API interactions.
- **Complex Authentication**: Master complex authentication and authorization flows, including OAuth 2.0 and JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Schema & Contract Testing**: Perform API schema validation using libraries like Zod or Ajv and understand the principles of contract testing.
- **Mocking & Stubbing**: Isolate tests by mocking and stubbing API dependencies and third-party services.
- **API Versioning**: Develop strategies to test for API versioning and ensure backward compatibility.
- **Performance Testing**: Conduct basic API performance and load testing to identify bottlenecks.
- **Rate Limiting**: Test for and handle API rate limiting and throttling scenarios.
- **Asynchronous APIs**: Create testing strategies for asynchronous APIs, including polling, webhooks, and WebSockets.
- **GraphQL Testing**: Understand and test GraphQL APIs, including queries, mutations, and subscriptions.
- **Microservices Testing**: Apply API testing principles within a microservices architecture, focusing on inter-service communication.
- **API Security Fundamentals**: Identify and test for common API security vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP API Security Top 10).
