## üìñ Key Concepts

### **Visual Regression Testing**
Visual regression testing compares the current visual appearance of a web application against a known baseline to detect unintended visual changes.

### **Baseline Images**
Reference images that represent the expected visual appearance of UI components or pages at a specific point in time.

### **Pixel Comparison**
The process of comparing images pixel by pixel to identify visual differences between baseline and current screenshots.

### **Threshold Configuration**
Settings that define acceptable levels of visual difference before a test is considered failed.
