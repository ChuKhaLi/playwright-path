## üìñ Key Concepts and Definitions

### **Contract Testing**
A testing approach that verifies the interactions between services by checking that the messages they send or receive conform to a shared understanding documented in a contract.

### **Consumer-Driven Contract Testing (CDC)**
A pattern where the consumer defines the contract based on their needs, and the provider must fulfill that contract.

### **Pact**
A contract testing framework that enables consumer-driven contract testing by allowing consumers to define their expectations of a provider.

### **Contract Broker**
A centralized repository for storing and managing contracts, enabling sharing between consumer and provider teams.

### **API Specification**
A formal description of an API's structure, endpoints, request/response formats, and behavior, typically using OpenAPI/Swagger.
